		<h1>The Origin and Meaning of Celtic Knotwork</h1>

		<p style="font-style: italic; ">
			Sorry, but it's probably just a pretty way to fill up an empty space.
		</p>

		<p>
		It is difficult to discuss the development and symbolism of
		Celtic knotwork without providing a lengthy history of the
		Celts for context, yet this is precisely what I am attempting
		to do in order to relate what I know in the fewest words
		possible. Therefore, if you feel this discussion is missing
		something, you're probably right.
		</p>
		<p>
		I encourage you to learn
		about Celtic history to fill in the gaps as well as for its
		own sake.
		You can find
		a list of staring places in the <a href="http://www.thinkythings.org/knotwork/celtbib-history.html">bibliography</a>.
		Most of the
		information I'm presenting here is taken from those sources,
		especially <cite>Celtic Art</cite> by J.R. Allen.
		</p>

		<h3>Origin</h3>

		<p>
		Prior to the Christian influence on the Celts (about A.D. 450),
		the only known Celtic artwork consisted of geometrical patterns
		such as spirals, key patterns, and step patterns. It has been
		suggested that the Celts' religion prevented them from depicting
		the works of the creator, namely animals, plants, and humans.
		That is why their artwork is restricted to geometrical patterns.
		</p>
		<p>
		Many of these
		patterns have similar or identical counterparts in early
		Christian manuscripts and artwork. There can be no doubt that
		the Christian Celtic artwork was strongly influenced by pagan
		Celtic sources. However, it is only in the artwork of the
		Christian era that we see knotwork. Besides knotwork, the
		Christian Celts also added human, plant, and animal forms
		to their decorations.
		</p>
		<p>
		Plaitwork, which is a pattern of interwoven (but unknotted)
		cords, is the earliest form of knotwork. (For examples of
		plaits, see <a href="http://www.thinkythings.org/knotwork/jra-knots.html">the eight basic
		knotwork forms</a>.) Plaitwork is
		not unique to the Celts; examples are found in many
		cultures. By breaking the plait's cords and reattaching them,
		knotwork patterns can be derived. The first examples of this
		practice came in the early 700's A.D. in Italy.
		This is about the time that the <cite>Book of Lindisfarne</cite>,
		the earliest illuminated manuscript featuring knotwork
		patterns, appeared.
		</p>

		<h3>Meaning</h3>

		<p>
		J. Romilly Allen has
		identified <a href="http://www.thinkythings.org/knotwork/jra-knots.html">eight basic knots</a>
		from which most Celtic knotwork patterns were derived.
		These knots appeared in repeating patterns that were
		used to fill borders and empty spaces in illuminated
		manuscripts, sculptures, and jewelry. The knots did
		not, generally, appear as isolated elements.
		</p>
		<p>
		Therefore, it's my opinion that the Celts did not use
		knots as specific symbols. They did not have different
		knots to represent specific ideas or concepts. Knots
		were just nifty ways to fill a space. The symbolism of
		connectedness and continuity seem apparent from simply
		looking at knotwork patterns. This may have been an
		intended effect, but I've uncovered no evidence to
		suggest that knotwork patterns mean anything more than
		that.
		</p>
		<p>
		This is likely to disappoint a great many people. Many
		visitors to my Web site ask if I have a list of knots
		and what they mean, or if I know of a knot that symbolizes
		a particular concept. I'm sorry, but my research indicates
		that the Celts who first drew knotwork patterns had no
		such meaning attached to their work.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now, there have been hundreds of years since knotwork
		patterns were first invented. It's not impossible that
		meanings have been attached to certain patterns over
		time. From what I can tell, such meanings do exist, but
		as far as I know, they are very localized and
		relatively recent in origin.
		</p>

		<p>
		Addendum: documented meanings I've found.
		</p>
		<p>
		In <cite>Brigit's Feast</cite> (Vol. 2 No. 1, pp. 9, 11)
		Frank Mills writes...
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		The interlaced patterns with their unbroken lines symbolize
		humankind's pilgrimage, both as a quest to return to our divine
		source and our spiritual growth as we move along in the quest.
		The pattern is to be mentally unraveled, which, while occupying
		the mind with a repetitive task, creates a deeper concentration
		enabling us "to see." In this it is akin to the use of a mantra
		or rosary beads.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
		...though in a footnote he says...
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		It must be remembered that in our interpretation of Celtic
		art we cannot know the mind of the ancient Celts who developed
		these forms, thus the best we can do is to hopefully 'read
		between the lines' correctly and make some educated guesses.
		</blockquote>
