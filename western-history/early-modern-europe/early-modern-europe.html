<h3>General Features</h3>

<p>The Early Modern age witnessed the ascent of <strong>Western Europe</strong> to global political, economic, and technological dominance. This ascent was gradual; only toward the end of the Early Modern age did Western power <strong>clearly surpass</strong> that of rival civilizations. Europe's <strong>chief rivals</strong> were found in the Middle East (Ottoman Empire), South Asia (<a class="tip" href="http://www.howjsay.com/index.php?word=mughal">Mughal</a> Empire), and East Asia (Ming/<a class="tip" href="../../college.cengage.com/history/world/bulliet/earth_peoples/2e/students/prguide/voice/0697.mp3">Qing</a> China).</p>

<p>The Early Modern age can be divided into two periods: the <strong>Reformation</strong> (ca. 1500-1650; see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/reformation">Reformation</a>) and the <strong>Enlightenment</strong> (ca. 1650-1800; see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>). The period can also be divided into two narratives: the history of the <strong>continent</strong> itself (the focus of this article), and the history of the <strong>overseas empires</strong> amassed by European powers (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/european-colonialism">European Colonialism</a>).</p>

<p>The vast economic and territorial <strong>expansion</strong> of the Early Modern age was a force for both good and ill. On the negative side, the <strong>scale of war</strong> between Western powers (in terms of troops, resources, and geographic extent) grew steadily. On the positive side, the Early Modern age witnessed the rise of a large <strong>middle class</strong> (e.g. merchants, artisans, officials), which greatly bolstered the spread of literacy and scholarship (given that the middle class possessed the time and wealth to become literate and pursue scholarly activities).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these dramatic changes, political power in Early Modern Europe remained concentrated in the hands of the <strong>upper class</strong>, composed primarily of nobility and clergy. A fundamental <strong>struggle</strong> emerged between the middle and upper class of each nation, often spurring attempted revolution. The old order (nobility and clergy) was finally displaced in the modern age (ca. 1800-present), when industrial manufacturing allowed <strong>capitalists</strong> to become the dominant economic class (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/western-economy">History of the Western Economy</a>).</p>

<h3>Centralization</h3>

<p>A <strong>country</strong>, as we use the term today, is an independent, centrally-governed territory. In Western Europe, countries only began to emerge toward the end of the medieval period, as monarchs finally managed to achieve firm <strong>centralized control</strong> over large regions. During the <strong>Reformation</strong>, the power of monarchs continued to grow, while the power of local nobles continued to decline.</p>

<p>In other words, Early Modern Europe experienced a <strong>transition</strong> from feudalism to absolutism. Under the <span style="font-weight: bold;">feudal system</span>, monarchs ruled their lands indirectly via hierarchies of nobility (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/feudalism-serfdom">Feudalism and Serfdom</a>), whereas an <span style="font-weight: bold;">absolutist</span> monarch directly rules an entire state, relatively free of interference from lesser nobles. The Reformation served as the <strong>transitional period</strong> between feudalism and absolutism, while the Enlightenment featured <strong>strongly absolutist</strong> monarchs; indeed, the Enlightenment period is also known as the "Age of Absolutism".</p>

<h3>Rise of Humanism</h3>

<p><strong>Humanism</strong> is "an outlook that emphasizes human capabilities and concerns" (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/humanism">Humanism</a>). It features two key assertions: that individuals should exercise <strong>critical thought</strong>, and that <strong>secular matters</strong> are important. Humanism forms the very <strong>core</strong> of Western civilization.</p>

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages, the <strong>Roman Catholic Church</strong> exerted <strong>religious authority</strong> over the entirety of Western Europe. The Church was also a major <strong>political and economic force</strong>, with many clergy holding posts in government and education, and enormous wealth being collected from land holdings and taxation. As the medieval period drew on, however, <strong>resistance</strong> to Church authority grew, due largely to the rise of the middle class (which possessed the time and literacy to study and denounce religious oppression). Church response to criticism varied from genuine <strong>reform efforts</strong> to horrific <strong>violence</strong>.</p>

<p>Humanism was nearly <strong>extinguished</strong> during the medieval period: critical thought was supplanted with blind acceptance of Church <strong>doctrine</strong>, and secular scholarship was largely <strong>abandoned</strong>. Since Church power depended on being perceived as unquestionable, it opposed both <strong>science</strong> (which could undermine theology) and <strong>liberalism</strong> (which would give people freedom to denounce the Church). Progress in these areas was frustrated until the overarching authority of the Church was shattered by the <strong>Reformation</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/reformation">Reformation</a>).</p>

<p>The success of the Reformation led to the <strong>Enlightenment</strong>, during which humanism reached its fully-developed form (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>). The full spectrum of <strong>secular subjects</strong> were eagerly explored, and all fields of knowledge were, at last, constantly tested with <strong>critical thought</strong>. The Enlightenment thus gave rise to the <strong>modern Western world</strong>, including modern science and liberal democracy.</p>

<h3>The Habsburgs</h3>

<p>One of the key royal houses of Europe was the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/cgi-bin/audio.pl?habsbu02.wav=Habsburg">Habsburg</a> dynasty, which ruled the <strong>Austrian Empire</strong> for the whole of its existence (ca. 1500-WWI). Up until ca. 1800, the Austrian Empire is also known as the <strong>Holy Roman Empire</strong>.</p>

<p>Habsburg power peaked when, via strategic marriage, a single Habsburg came to be (simultaneously) the <strong>Spanish king</strong> and <strong>Holy Roman emperor</strong>. This man is known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles V</span> (Holy Roman emperor) or <strong>Charles I</strong> (king of Spain). Charles' dual reign spanned roughly four decades, near the beginning of the Reformation period.</p>

<div class="slider-single">

</div>

<p>After Charles, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire were once again ruled <strong>separately</strong>, each by a line of the Habsburg family. The <strong>Austrian Habsburgs</strong> ruled the Austrian Empire for the remainder of its history (until WWI), while the <strong>Spanish Habsburgs</strong> ruled Spain until ca. 1700 (when the line went extinct, precipitating the War of the Spanish Succession).</p>

<p>The <strong>Reformation</strong> featured constant <strong>religion-based conflict</strong> (namely Catholic-Protestant conflict) within and between the nations of Western Europe. Religious fervour was, of course, often entangled with <strong>political interests</strong>.</p>

<p>The most powerful nations of Reformation Europe were <strong>Spain</strong> (the mightiest), <strong>France</strong>, and <strong>Austria</strong>.  Alliances of the Reformation generally coincided with <strong>religion</strong>: Protestant regions on one side (Germany, Netherlands, England, Scandinavia), Catholic regions on the other (Spain, Holy Roman Empire). The chief exception was <strong>France</strong>, which despite being Catholic was determined to break the power of the Habsburgs.</p>

<p>The Reformation can be divided into two parts: a period of <span style="font-weight: bold;">escalating conflict</span> between Protestants and Roman Catholics (ca. 1500-1618) and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thirty Years' War</span> (ca. 1618-48).</p>

<p>The <strong>primary struggles</strong> of the "escalating conflict" period were the Italian Wars and the Dutch Revolt, both of which lasted decades. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Italian Wars</span>, fought between Spain and France over Italian territory, ended in Spanish victory. In the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dutch Revolt</span> (aka the Eighty Years' War), the Netherlands won independence from Spanish rule. (The final three decades of the the Dutch Revolt overlap with the Thirty Years' War.)</p>

<p>The region of "the Netherlands" comprises the northern half of the <strong>Low Countries</strong>. While the Low Countries were largely independent during the Middle Ages, they became a firm <strong>Habsburg possession</strong> ca. 1500. The <strong>Netherlands</strong> broke free during the Reformation, while the southern Low Countries (now <strong>Belgium</strong>) would not achieve independence until the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thirty Years' War</span> (1618-1648), fought mainly in Germany, centred on the struggle of the <strong>German states</strong> against <strong>Austria</strong> for political and religious autonomy. (While Germany officially belonged to the Holy Roman Empire, the region was actually a patchwork of small, semi-independent states.) Austria was aided by <strong>Spain</strong>, while the German states were supported chiefly by <strong>Denmark</strong>, <strong>Sweden</strong>, and <strong>France</strong>. Over <strong>seven million</strong> were killed in the Thirty Years' War, making it the bloodiest conflict in Europe prior to the First World War.<span class="super">K262-263,8</span></p>

<p>The Thirty Years' War initially erupted in <strong>Bohemia</strong> (part of Austrian territory), when enraged Protestants (a strong minority group in that region) burst into the king's palace and hurled several officials through a window: an event referred to as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Defenestration of Prague</span>. War subsequently raged in <strong>Bohemia</strong> (for the first few years of the war), then primarily <strong>Germany</strong> (for the remainder). Austria was ultimately defeated, with the treaty that ended the war (the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Peace of <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggwest25&word=Westphalia&text=\west-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ef%C4%81l-y%C9%99%2C%20-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ef%C4%81-l%C4%93-%C9%99\">Westphalia</a></span>) granting religious and political autonomy to the German states. (In Bohemia, however, the Protestant rebellion was <strong>quelled</strong>, and Austrian control of the region remained firm.)<span class="super">8,9</span></p>

<p>Under the <strong>Tudor</strong> dynasty (ca. 1500-1600), England bloomed into a major power. The conversion of England to Protestantism was initiated by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Henry VIII</span> (the second Tudor), who proclaimed himself head of Catholicism in England (instead of the pope) in response to the pope's refusal to grant him a divorce. Over the Tudor period, England came to abandon Catholicism altogether, with Protestantism being permanently established as the state religion of England by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Elizabeth I</span> (the last Tudor).<span class="super">67</span></p>

<p>The Tudors were succeeded by the <strong>Stuart</strong> dynasty. Its first two members were <span style="font-weight: bold;">James I</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles I</span>, both of whom provoked civil unrest via brutal anti-Catholicism, heavy taxation, and contempt for Parliament. Under James' reign, this unrest culminated in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gunpowder Plot</span>, a Catholic attempt to blow up Parliament. Under Charles' reign, unrest finally erupted into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">English Revolution</span>.<span class="super">68</span></p>

<p>The period known as the English Revolution (ca. 1640-60) had <strong>two phases</strong>. The first half of this period was spanned by the <strong>English Civil War</strong>, which ultimately deposed Charles I. The second half was spanned by the <strong>Commonwealth</strong> (a dictatorship ruled by Oliver Cromwell), during which civil conflict continued. In 1660, the Stuart monarchy was <strong>restored</strong>.</p>

<p>The English Civil War was fought between the <strong>Royalists</strong> (supporters of the king, composed primarily of high-ranking nobles) and the <strong>Parliamentarians</strong> (supporters of Parliament, composed primarily of lesser nobles and the middle class). The war ended in <strong>Parliamentarian victory</strong> and Charles' execution.<span class="super">70</span></p>

<p><strong>Parliament</strong> was the representative assembly of England. (A <strong>representative assembly</strong> is a body of representatives from across a country, who gather to participate in the governance of that country.) While representative assemblies emerged in various Western European states during the Middle Ages, most remained mere advisory bodies; only Parliament achieved <strong>real political power</strong>, such that it could significantly limit the actions of the monarch (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/democracy">History of Democracy</a>).</p>

<p>While Parliament was initially dominated by the <strong>nobility</strong>, throughout the Reformation it increasingly became the political voice of the <strong>middle class</strong>.<span class="super">70</span> Members of Parliament were <strong>elected</strong>, albeit only by a fraction of the population (due to property requirements for suffrage). Nonetheless, this was the starting-point of modern <strong>democracy</strong>, and Parliament is the ancestor of all modern democratic governments.</p>

<p>For most of Europe, the Enlightenment was the <strong>age of absolutism</strong>, during which monarchs achieved an unprecedented degree of absolute rule over their nations. Thanks to Parliament, England was the chief <strong>exception</strong> to this rule. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 came with strong <strong>conditions</strong>, namely that monarchs would recognize the legal authority Parliament had obtained up to that point, as well as some additional power. Thus does the English Revolution mark the decisive, permanent <strong>end of absolutism</strong> in England. (This was reaffirmed a few decades later by the brief <strong>Glorious Revolution</strong>, in which another Stuart king with absolutist ambitions was deposed by Parliamentary forces.)<span class="super">A296-97,79</span></p>

<p>England thus became the first major power to feature <strong>representative government</strong> (i.e. government in which significant political power is held by a representative assembly). This did not go unnoticed: from the English Revolution onward, demand for representative government was <strong>constant</strong> throughout the Western world.<span class="super">78</span> Representative government (and British culture generally) also spread via exportation from Britain to its <strong>colonies</strong>, including the United States (which, some two centuries after the English Revolution, would become the world's first true democracy).</p>

<p>During the period from the Enlightenment to World War I (ca. 1650-WWI), the primary powers of Europe were <strong>France</strong>, <strong>England</strong>, <strong>Austria</strong>, <strong>Prussia</strong> (later Germany), and <strong>Russia</strong>. During the <strong>Early Enlightenment</strong> (ca. 1648-1715), France waxed as the most powerful nation of the five (under Louis XIV). During the <strong>Late Enlightenment</strong> (ca. 1715-1800), the five nations were more evenly matched, comprising a five-way "balance of power".<span class="super">2</span></p>

</div>

<p>Note that the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> was also a major force in European politics for the whole of its existence (ca. 1300-WWI).</p>

<p>The reign of the French king <span style="font-weight: bold;">Louis XIV</span> (aka the "Sun King") spanned the entire Early Enlightenment. Louis' reign was characterized by extensive <strong>patronage of the arts</strong>, ruthless persecution of the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=huguen01&word=Huguenot&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ehy%C3%BC-g%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3En%C3%A4t\">Huguenots</a> (which virtually ended Protestantism in France), and constant wars of <strong>attempted expansion</strong>.<span class="super">51</span> These attempts compelled other European powers to unite into an anti-French <strong>coalition</strong>, whose membership fluctuated throughout the decades (but was consistently led by England and Austria).</p>

<p>The foremost conflict of the Early Enlightenment was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">War of the Spanish Succession</span> (1701-14), which spanned the final years of Louis XIV's reign. This conflict resulted from the extinction of the <strong>Habsburg dynasty</strong> in Spain, which caused Louis' grandson Philip to inherit the Spanish throne; left unchecked, this would eventually have led to the <strong>union</strong> of France and Spain under a single monarch. The anti-French coalition averted this danger by attacking and <strong>defeating</strong> both nations; in the resulting <strong>peace settlement</strong>, France and Spain were forbidden from ever uniting, and both were stripped of significant territories.<span class="super">52,53</span></p>

<p>The foremost conflict of the Late Enlightenment (along with the American and French Revolutions) was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Seven Years' War</span> (1756-63), which involved most of Europe. Fighting took place both in <strong>Europe</strong> itself and throughout the <strong>world</strong>, between the European empires. Indeed, the Seven Years' War is often cited as the first <strong>global conflict</strong>.</p>

<p>At the core of this conflict was the <strong>British-French struggle</strong> for world supremacy. The Enlightenment period witnessed a <strong>string of wars</strong> between these nations over control of India, North America, and the Caribbean. More often than not, Britain claimed victory in these wars, such that French territory was slowly <strong>eroded</strong>.</p>

<p>Victory in the Seven Years' War allowed the British Empire to absorb <strong>New France</strong> (French territory in North America) and ejected the French from <strong>India</strong>. The Seven Years' War thus marks the rise of the <strong>British Empire</strong> as the supreme global colonial power. By imposing new taxes on colonies (due to massive war debts), however, Britain spurred the <span style="font-weight: bold;">American Revolution</span>, which France was only too eager to support.<span class="super">73</span></p>

<h3>Russia and Prussia</h3>

<p>The history of Russia began ca. 1500, when <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ivan the Great</span> founded the nation by freeing his East Slavic land (known as <a class="tip" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggmusc03&word=Muscovy&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Em%C9%99s-k%C9%99-v%C4%93\">Muscovy</a>) from Turkic domination. Russian territory <strong>expanded</strong> steadily throughout the Early Modern period, especially eastward. Ivan the Great was succeeded by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ivan the Terrible</span>, the first Russian ruler to be titled <span style="font-weight: bold;">tsar</span>. Soon after, the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.howjsay.com/index.php?word=romanov">Romanov</a> dynasty came to power, remaining there until the position of tsar was terminated during WWI.<span class="super">41,42</span></p>

<p>The foremost monarch of Enlightenment Russia was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Peter the Great</span>, who effected an ambitious program of "Westernization" to bring Russian government, military, and technology up to Western standards. He established Russian naval power by founding <span style="font-weight: bold;">St Petersburg</span> on the Baltic coast, which served as the nation's capital until World War I.<span class="super">42</span></p>

<p>The Enlightenment also witnessed the emergence of the nation of <strong>Prussia</strong>. "Prussia" was originally a state centred on modern-day northeast Poland, established by the <strong><a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=teuton02&word=Teutonic&text=\t%C3%BC-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Et%C3%A4-nik%2C%20ty%C3%BC-\">Teutonic</a> Knights</strong> during the later Middle Ages. <strong>Poland</strong> conquered the region soon afterward, but allowed the Knights to keep part of it as a duchy. During the Reformation, this duchy was inherited by the prince of <strong>Brandenburg</strong> (one of the small German states under the Holy Roman Empire); during the Enlightenment, Prussia broke free as an <strong>independent kingdom</strong> and expanded rapidly, joining up with Brandenburg to form a single great power.</p>

<h3>French Revolution</h3>

<p>The Enlightenment concluded with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">French Revolution</span> (1789-99), effected by the French peasantry and middle class in response to heavy regressive taxation.<span class="super">2</span> Taxes on food, for instance, were so high as to bring about <strong>famine</strong> among the lower classes. Escalating civil unrest forced Louis XVI to summon the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Estates-General</span> in a desperate bid to implement satisfactory political reforms, including an acceptable system of taxation (which was needed to manage the towering national debt).<span class="super">58</span></p>

<p>The Estates-General was, like England's Parliament, a <strong>representative assembly</strong> established during the Middle Ages. Unlike Parliament, the Estates-General had never attained significant political power, and so had remained chiefly <strong>advisory</strong>.</p>

<p>The Estates-General consisted of representatives from <strong>three groups</strong>: nobility, clergy, and commoners (known as the three "estates"). Though discussions ensued, the commoners lost patience and demanded control of the nation, dubbing themselves the <span style="font-weight: bold;">National Assembly</span>. Before long, the king reluctantly <strong>acknowledged</strong> the National Assembly as the new government of France.<span class="super">58</span></p>

<p>The new regime would not be established peacefully, however: in 1789, fears of a noble plot to restore the monarchy drove the commoners to storm the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=bastil01&word=bastille&text=\ba-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Est%C4%93%28%C9%99%29l\">Bastille</a> (a prison fortress) for weapons. This act is considered the beginning of the <strong>French Revolution</strong>.<span class="super">58</span></p>

<p>The Revolution featured a series of <strong>failed attempts</strong> at establishing democratic government. Meanwhile, violence raged both within France (against counter-revolutionaries and between rival revolutionary factions) and against other European nations in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">French Revolutionary Wars</span>, through which France expanded eastward. Thousands of perceived enemies of the Revolution were <strong>beheaded</strong>, including Louis XVI and his queen, Marie Antoinette.<span class="super">58</span></p>

<p>The Revolution ended when <strong>Napoleon</strong>, a celebrated military officer of the French Revolutionary Wars, seized control of the nation in 1799. Though not declared "emperor" for some years, his rule was <strong>dictatorial</strong> from the start. War with Europe continued; the French Revolutionary Wars simply became the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Napoleonic Wars</span> (1799-1815).<span class="super">58,74</span></p>

<p>While the French Revolution did not succeed in founding democratic government, it did initiate the downfall of <strong>absolutism</strong> in France. The Revolution also bolstered a range of <strong>freedoms</strong> in French society, including freedom of speech and religion. The ideals and reforms of the French Revolution proved widely <strong>influential</strong>, especially across Continental Europe.<span class="super">A327</span></p>
