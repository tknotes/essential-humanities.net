<h3>General Features</h3>

<p>From the modern perspective, the general features of human life <strong>changed little</strong> in the period from the rise of civilization to ca. 1800. Up until the modern age (ca. 1800-present), societies were predominantly <strong>rural</strong> (with most of the population devoted to farming) and <strong>economies</strong> were based chiefly on agriculture, manufacture of goods by hand, and trade. No matter how powerful, wealthy, or scholarly the world's civilizations became, these <strong>basic conditions</strong> of society remained constant.</p>

<p>During the modern age, human life was <strong>revolutionized</strong> in virtually every corner of the globe. The most obvious engine of change is <strong>technology</strong>: with the development of steam-driven machines, many economies (starting with Britain) became dominated by <strong>mechanized production</strong>, which in turn drove unprecedented levels of <strong>urbanization</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/industrial-revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>). Other key technological developments include high-speed global networks of <strong>communication</strong> (from the telegraph to the internet) and <strong>transportation</strong> (from steamships to jet aircraft).</p>

<p>Industrialized food production fuelled massive <strong>population growth</strong>, which compelled many Europeans to <strong>emigrate</strong> to the New World (especially the United States). Population was also driven by large increases in <strong>life expectancy</strong>, thanks to improved <strong>nutrition</strong> (enabled by modern transportation and storage), advances in <strong>medical science</strong> (whose impact on human health soared in the modern period), and <strong>public health</strong> efforts (e.g. water and sewage systems, garbage collection, environmental regulations).<span class="super">A340-41,9</span></p>

<p>The modern age also witnessed the rise of mature <strong>capitalism</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/western-economy">History of the Western Economy</a>). The <strong>traditional ruling class</strong> (nobility and clergy), whose wealth was based on land ownership and taxation, was gradually supplanted by <strong>capitalists</strong>, whose wealth is based on production of goods and services. In pre-modern times, capitalists (e.g. artisans, traders) had generally occupied the <strong>middle class</strong>.</p>

<p>During the period from the Enlightenment to World War I (ca. 1650-WWI), the five most powerful nations of Europe were <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Britain</strong>, <strong>Austria</strong>, <strong>Prussia</strong> (later Germany), and <strong>Russia</strong>. Austria's power was broken in the First World War, such that the strongest European nations since WWI have been the <strong>big four</strong>: France, Britain, Germany, and Russia.</p>

<h3>The Two Pillars of the West</h3>

<p>Arguably, the two most fundamental components of Western society are <strong>science</strong> and <strong>liberal democracy</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/science">History of Science</a>, <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/democracy">History of Democracy</a>). The unprecedented average <strong>quality of life</strong> throughout the Western world may be primarily attributed to these two "pillars of the West". In the modern age, these "pillars" (along with Western culture generally) became widely <strong>influential</strong> across the non-Western world.</p>

<p>Upon the ascent of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Napoleon Bonaparte</span> as dictator of France (1799), the French Revolutionary Wars became the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=bixnap07&word=Napoleonic&text=\n%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Ep%C5%8D-l%C4%93-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3E%C3%A4-nik\">Napoleonic</a> Wars</span> (1799-1815), which drew in most of Europe. Napoleon, who eventually declared France to be an "empire" (and therefore himself an "emperor"), brought much of Continental Europe under French control, partly in the form of <strong>satellite states</strong> (which are officially independent but significantly controlled by a dominant state).<span class="super">6</span> His defeat of <strong>Austria</strong> terminated that nation's title of "Holy Roman Empire".</p>

<p>Napoleon's ambitions to invade Britain were thwarted, however, by the naval battle of <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggtraf01&word=Trafalgar%2C%20Cape&text=\tr%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Efal-g%C9%99r%2C%20%3Cem%3ESp%3C%2Fem%3E%20%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Etr%C3%A4-f%C3%A4l-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Eg%C3%A4r\">Trafalgar</a>, in which the French Empire's main fleet (comprised of French and Spanish vessels) was defeated by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Horatio Nelson</span> in waters southwest of Spain. Following this victory, British dominance of the world's oceans remained <strong>unchallenged</strong> for the duration of the Pax Britannica. Napoleon thenceforward ignored Britain and focused on the <strong>Continental campaign</strong>.<span class="super">K306-07,6</span></p>

<p>Napoleon's downfall began with his invasion of <strong>Russia</strong>; following the temporary seizure of Moscow, his forces were decimated by the freezing winter and Russian counterattack. Driven back westward, the final blow came with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle of <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggleip01&word=Leipzig&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3El%C4%ABp-sig%2C%20-sik\">Leipzig</a></span>, followed by the invasion of France and Napoleon's forced abdication (1814). In 1815, Napoleon escaped from exile (on the island of Elba) and regained power for a brief period known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hundred Days</span>; this time he was permanently defeated at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterloo</span>, Belgium, by Britain and Prussia.<span class="super">6,16</span></p>

<p>At the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Congress of Vienna</span> (the subsequent peace settlement), national borders were restored to their pre-French Revolution configuration, and the old <strong>five-way balance</strong> of European power was restored. Napoleon's influence lived on, however, in his <strong>administrative reforms</strong>. Most famously, he instituted a national <strong>civil law code</strong> (the Napoleonic Code, which became the model for the modern legal systems of Continental Europe) and nationalized the <strong>education system</strong>.<span class="super">5,8</span></p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pax Britannica</span> (ca. 1815-1914) was an age of relative peace, due largely to Britain's overwhelming global <strong>naval supremacy</strong>. This period marks the height of European dominance over the <strong>Old World</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/european-colonialism">European Colonialism</a>). The peace of the Pax Britannica was finally shattered by the <strong>First World War</strong>, the bloodiest conflict the world had ever known.<span class="super">A354,A436,K287,3</span></p>

<p>The Pax Britannica can be summarized in three major developments. First, this period witnessed the flourishing of the <strong>British Empire</strong> as the supreme global colonial power. Second, <strong>Prussia</strong> successfully warred against both Austria (Austro-Prussian War) and France (Franco-Prussian War), then <strong>united Germany</strong> (which had comprised a patchwork of small states since the medieval period). And third, <strong>Russia</strong> continued to expand, but was checked by the Crimean War and Russo-Japanese War.</p>

<p>The prosperity of the nineteenth-century <strong>British Empire</strong> was based primarily on the conquest and exploitation of <strong>India</strong>, whose population exceeded that of all other British territories combined. (Note that in historical discussion, "India" denotes South Asia.) British India was not a target of European settlement, however; the British presence consisted of a small <strong>ruling class</strong>, whose power rested on a combination of British <strong>military power</strong> and <strong>diplomacy</strong> with indigenous rulers.<span class="super">A388-89,25</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <strong>expansion of Russia</strong> continued throughout the nineteenth century. This eventually sparked the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a class="tipbold" href="http://www.wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/audio.pl?ggcrim02.wav=Crimean">Crimean</a> War</span> (1853-56), fought between Russia and the forces of Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire for control of territory in Eastern Europe; the war centred on the Crimean Peninsula (now part of Ukraine).<span class="super">16</span> As Ottoman power <strong>waned</strong>, Russia sought to extend its grasp over Eastern Europe, while Britain and France sought to frustrate these efforts. The war, though infamous for its clumsiness and heavy casualties on both sides, did stem Russian expansion.<span class="super">43</span></p>

<p>Russian conquest was also frustrated in Asia, where the nation struggled with newly-modernized <strong>Japan</strong> for control of northeastern China and the Korean Peninsula. The unexpected Russian defeat in the <strong><a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=russo_01&word=Russo-&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Er%C9%99-%28%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3E%29s%C5%8D%2C%20%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Er%C3%BC-%2C%20-%28%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3E%29sh%C5%8D\">Russo</a>-Japanese War</strong> (1904-05) announced the rise of Japan as a primary world power.</p>

<p>Following the Napoleonic Wars, the patchwork of German states (of which Austria and Prussia were the strongest) were grouped into an alliance termed the <span style="font-weight: bold;">German Confederation</span>. A contest ensued between Austria and Prussia to lead the union of the Confederation into a single German nation, culminating in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Austro-Prussian War</span> (1866), from which Prussia emerged victorious. Prussia was then attacked by France, which hoped to prevent the rise of a unified Germany; the consequent <span style="font-weight: bold;">Franco-Prussian War</span> (1870-71) also ended in Prussian victory.<span class="super">1,13,14</span></p>

<p>Having fended off these two great rivals, Prussia finally united the Confederation (minus Austria) into the <strong>German Empire</strong>, which became the foremost power of the European continent. Prussian victory in both wars was due largely to the keen strategy of the king's top minister, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Otto von Bismarck</span>. The founding of the German Empire (1871) marks the birth of <strong>modern Germany</strong>, and Bismarck is often cited as the "father of modern Germany".<span class="super">A396,1,13,14</span></p>

<p>As Austria reeled from defeat in the Austro-Prussian War, <strong>Hungary</strong> successfully demanded recognition as a separate kingdom within the Austrian Empire. This victory, though falling short of full independence, gave Hungary significant control over its domestic affairs. From this point forward, the Austrian Empire is often referred to as <strong>Austria-Hungary</strong>, or the "Austro-Hungarian Empire".<span class="super">1,13,14</span></p>

<h3>Russian Revolution</h3><span class="date">1917</span>

<p>As the Pax Britannica drew on, Russia experienced growing <strong>social unrest</strong>, culminating under <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nicholas II</span> (the final tsar). Nicholas witnessed the rise of a powerful <strong>communist party</strong> led by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vladimir Lenin</span> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/marxism">Marxism</a>).<span class="super">16</span></p>

<p>Revolutionary sentiments surged with Nicholas' loss of the <strong>Russo-Japanese War</strong>, then exploded with the staggering casualties of the <strong>First World War</strong>. In the subsequent <span style="font-weight: bold;">Russian Revolution</span> (1917), Lenin seized control of the country, sparking years of civil war (between Lenin's party, rival revolutionary forces, and counter-revolutionaries). State seizure of <strong>private lands</strong> collapsed the power of nobility and clergy.<span class="super">A434-38,16,17</span></p>

<p>Russia was proclaimed a <strong>soviet socialist republic</strong>. In the years that followed, the formation of other "soviet socialist republics" (e.g. Ukraine, Belarus) and their union with Russia gave rise to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</span> (USSR), which included most of Eastern Europe. The USSR was the furthest thing from a republic, however: a brutal socialist <strong>dictatorship</strong>, rife with spying, imprisonment (often at forced labour camps in Siberia), torture, and execution.<span class="super">A434-38,K378-79</span></p>

<p>World War I (1914-18; see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/world-war-i">World War I</a>) was fought between the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Central Powers</span> (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey) and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allied Powers</span> (Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Japan, United States).<span class="super">38</span> At war's end, each of the Central Powers ceased to be an <strong>empire</strong>. Austria and Germany became <strong>republics</strong> (thus ending Habsburg rule of Austria), while the Ottoman Empire became the modern nation of <strong>Turkey</strong>.</p>

<p>World War I left Europe <strong>exhausted</strong>, psychologically and economically. Misery was compounded by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">1918 flu pandemic</span>, which spread throughout most of world, killing <strong>tens of millions</strong> of people (far more than the war itself) over a period of a few years.<span class="super">1</span></p>

<p>Interwar Europe featured three competing political systems: <strong>democracy</strong>, <strong>socialist dictatorship</strong>, and <strong>fascism</strong>. Britain, France, and Scandinavia remained democratic, while Russia continued as a socialist dictatorship. (Lenin was succeeded in the interwar period by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Joseph Stalin</span>.) Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, on the other hand, all fell to fascism in the 1930s.</p>

<p>The terms "authoritarianism" and "<a class="tip" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=totali04&word=totalitarianism&text=\%28%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3E%29t%C5%8D-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eta-l%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Eter-%C4%93-%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eni-z%C9%99m\">totalitarianism</a>" denote a government with absolute power; <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=fascis01&word=fascism&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Efa-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eshi-z%C9%99m%20%3Cem%3Ealso%3C%2Fem%3E%20%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Efa-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Esi-\">fascism</a> is a specific modern form of authoritarianism that emerged after World War I. Under a fascist regime, individuals are expected to submit completely to the will of the state, and to scorn any form of democracy or dissidence; the national leader is to be worshipped as a demi-god, and a culture of military aggression is fostered (typically rooted in myths of "racial supremacy").<span class="super">15</span> Fascism is considered the <strong>extreme right-wing</strong> form of modern government, while socialist dictatorship is the <strong>extreme left-wing</strong> form, though the consequences of both government types are largely indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Italy was seized by <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=bixmus04&word=Benito&text=\b%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3En%C4%93-%28%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3E%29t%C5%8D\">Benito</a> <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=bixmus03&word=Mussolini&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Em%C3%BC-s%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3El%C4%93-n%C4%93%2C%20%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Em%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3Eu%CC%87%3C%2Fspan%3E-\">Mussolini</a>, while Germany (whose brief post-WWI government is known as the "<a class="tip" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggweim01&word=Weimar&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ev%C4%AB-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Em%C3%A4r%2C%20%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ew%C4%AB-\">Weimar</a> Republic") fell to the Nazi party of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adolf Hitler</span> in 1933. Austria, initially governed by a home-grown fascist party, was swiftly <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=annex002&word=annex&text=\%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Eneks%2C%20%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ea-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eneks\">annexed</a> by Nazi Germany. Spain was taken by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Francisco <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=bixfra09&word=Franco&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Efr%C3%A4%C5%8B-%28%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3E%29k%C5%8D%2C%20%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Efra%C5%8B-\">Franco</a></span>, Portugal by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Antonio <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=bixsal10&word=Salazar&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Esa-l%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ez%C3%A4r%2C%20%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Es%C3%A4-\">Salazar</a></span>. While <strong>democracy</strong> was restored in West Germany, Austria, and Italy after WWII, Spain and Portugal would not become democratic until the 1970s.</p>

<p>Franco came to power following the <strong>Spanish Civil War</strong> of the late 1930s, in which <strong>conservative rebels</strong> fought to overthrow the democratically elected <strong>left-wing government</strong>. The rebels consisted largely of the <strong>old order</strong> (nobility and clergy), whose power and wealth were being eroded by left-wing government reforms. The <strong>government</strong> was supported by democratic European nations and Russia, while the <strong>rebels</strong> were aided by Germany and Italy.<span class="super">B302,K388-89</span></p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Treaty of <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggvers01&word=Versailles&text=\%28%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3E%29v%C9%99r-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Es%C4%AB%2C%20ver-\">Versailles</a></span> (the WWI peace settlement) is generally viewed as a major factor in the rise of fascism, given the <strong>harsh punishments</strong> it imposed on Germany and Austria (notably reparation payments and territorial losses) and the limited gains it provided for Italy. Though the treaty also established the <span style="font-weight: bold;">League of Nations</span> (the precursor to the United Nations) to help keep the peace, this organization proved ineffectual. Another exacerbating factor was the suffering caused by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Great Depression</span> of the 1930s, which spread from the United States throughout Europe.<span class="super">1,32</span></p>

<p>Hitler referred to Nazi Germany as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Third <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=bixrei02&word=Reich&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Er%C4%ABk\">Reich</a></span> ("Third Empire"), labelling it the successor to the Holy Roman Empire and the German Empire. As Hitler expanded his control of Central Europe, Britain and France attempted to avoid war through a policy of <span style="font-weight: bold;">appeasement</span>, allowing him to annex nearby lands (first Austria, then Czechoslovakia) in hopes that he would eventually be satisfied (and to stall for time while they built up their armed forces). Upon the German invasion of <strong>Poland</strong> in September 1939, Britain and France finally declared war (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/world-war-ii">World War II</a>).<span class="super">1</span> In the ensuing <strong>Second World War</strong>, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Axis Powers</span> (Germany, Italy, Japan) were defeated by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allied Powers</span> (Britain, France, Russia, China, US).<span class="super">39</span></p>

<h3>Cold War</h3><span class="date">ca. 1945-91</span>

<p>Following World War II, the global balance of power shifted to two <strong>superpowers</strong>: the US and USSR. Their rivalry manifested as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cold War</span> (ca. 1945-1991), which ended with the fall of communist Russia (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/cold-war">Cold War</a>). Economically speaking, Western Europe <strong>thrived</strong> during the Cold War period, whereas the communist East <strong>stagnated</strong>. And while unrest in the Western world was generally met with <strong>constructive intervention</strong>, disturbances in Eastern Europe were <strong>brutally crushed</strong>.<span class="super">1</span></p>

<p>The war was "cold" in that the two superpowers did not <strong>clash directly</strong>, due largely to the high probability of <strong>mutual annihilation</strong> in the nuclear age.<span class="super">33</span> Instead, each side waged a largely diplomatic and economic war, providing foreign governments with <strong>political support</strong> and <strong>funding</strong> in exchange for allegiance.<span class="super">34</span> Combat was limited to <strong>proxy wars</strong>, in which the US and USSR supplied troops and/or resources to opposing sides in <strong>local struggles</strong> (e.g. Korea, Vietnam).</p>

<h3>Contemporary Europe</h3><span class="date">ca. 1991-present</span>

<p>Since the Cold War, which ended with the <strong>disintegration</strong> of the USSR, Western tensions with Russia have <strong>relaxed</strong>. Post-Soviet Eastern Europe has faced <strong>severe challenges</strong>, including corruption, unemployment, inflation, and civil conflict. Nonetheless, most Eastern European nations have become truly <strong>democratic</strong> since the Cold War, though Russia itself remains a <strong>dictatorship</strong>.<span class="super">1,42,54</span></p>

<p>From WWI to the end of the Cold War, much of the Slavic-speaking region of the Balkans was united as the nation of <strong>Yugoslavia</strong> ("land of the South Slavs"). The 1990s <strong>fracturing</strong> of this region into small states constitutes the bloodiest European conflict of the post-Cold War era. The fighting (which principally involved Croats, Serbs, and Bosnians) took place along both <strong>political</strong> and <strong>ethnic</strong> lines, and was especially fierce in the region of <strong>Bosnia</strong>.</p>

<p>On the positive side, the 1990s witnessed the formation of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">European Union</span>, a political/economic alliance of European states. The precursor to this union was the <strong>European Economic Community</strong> (aka European Common Market), established after WWII to coordinate national coal and steel industries. The European Union brought the continent's <strong>economic integration</strong> to new heights, including a common European currency and a central bank.<span class="super">1,40</span></p>
