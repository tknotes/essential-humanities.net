<h3>Geography</h3>

<p>The continental United States can be divided into four main regions: <strong>Northeast</strong>, <strong>Midwest</strong>, <strong>West</strong>, and <strong>South</strong>. The West is often subdivided into the <strong>Pacific</strong> and <strong>Mountain</strong> states, while the Northeast consists of the <strong>Mid-Atlantic</strong> and <strong>New England</strong> states.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century, <span style="font-weight: bold;">New York</span> emerged as the largest American city (and the nation's cultural capital), which it remains today. The second-largest American city of that century was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chicago</span>, hence the nickname "Second City". Chicago now ranks third, however, having been surpassed in the twentieth century by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Los Angeles</span>.</p>

<p>European colonialism in America began shortly after the arrival of <strong>Columbus</strong>, with the Spanish settlement of <strong>Florida</strong>. Permanent English settlement dates to ca. 1600, with the founding of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jamestown</span>, Virginia. Thenceforward, <strong>British colonies</strong> came to dominate most of the eastern coast of what is now America. The inhabitants of these colonies perceived themselves as British until the decades leading up to independence; only then did a unique <strong>American identity</strong> emerge.<span class="super">5,31</span></p>

<p>Of all the imperial European powers, the British were by far the most successful in attracting European <strong>immigrants</strong> to their colonies (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/european-colonialism">European Colonialism</a>). These immigrants, while largely British (i.e. English, Scottish, or Irish), arrived from many different European countries.<span class="super">A323,5</span></p>

<p>Some colonies were owned by the <strong>monarch</strong>, others by British <strong>nobles</strong>, and still others by chartered <strong>companies</strong>. A fundamental economic distinction emerged between the rural <strong>southern colonies</strong>, whose economies relied largely on a few plantation crops (e.g. tobacco, rice, indigo, cotton), and the relatively urbanized <strong>northern colonies</strong>, whose economies were more diverse (including both raw material production and manufacturing). The northern colonies also tended to be more <strong>socially progressive</strong>.<span class="super">A271,5</span></p>

<p>Naturally, <strong>British culture</strong> was imported to the American colonies. Two critical features of this culture were <strong>representative government</strong> (in which representatives from across a nation participate in the governance of that nation; see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/democracy">History of Democracy</a>) and <strong>liberalism</strong> (in which government prioritizes individual freedom; see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>). In Britain, representative government was achieved through <strong>Parliament</strong>, which significantly limited the monarch's power; consequently, individual freedoms (e.g. freedom of speech and religion, freedom of economic activity, freedom from arbitrary imprisonment) were relatively strong in Britain (compared to the rest of Europe, which generally featured absolutist monarchs). Crucially, liberalism allowed <strong>capitalism</strong> to thrive (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/western-economy">History of the Western Economy</a>).<span class="super">A372-73,H880,K236-39,K270-71</span></p>

<p>Thus did <strong>British colonies</strong>, via strong traditions of representative government, liberalism, and capitalism, grow prosperous and self-reliant, making them well-prepared for <strong>independence</strong>. In sharp contrast, the colonies of <strong>other nations</strong> tended to feature centralized, <strong>absolutist</strong> governments (in emulation of their home nations, e.g. France, Spain), in which economic activity was <strong>rigidly controlled</strong>; these colonies remained politically and economically <strong>undeveloped</strong>, and thus poorly prepared for independence. Indeed, non-British colonies in the Americas were generally treated as <strong>extraction colonies</strong>; raw material production (especially plantation agriculture and mining) was the only form of economic development, and political development was limited to the minimum required for these simple economies to function.<span class="super">A271,B208,B253,K234-39,5</span></p>

<p>During the colonial age, Britain struggled with <strong>Spain</strong> (in the South) and the <strong>Netherlands</strong> (in the Northeast) for control of eastern North America. (The short-lived Dutch territory in North America was known as "New Netherland"; the city of New York was originally the Dutch settlement of "New Amsterdam".) Yet Britain's foremost colonial rival was <strong>France</strong>, whose territory in North America was called <strong>New France</strong>. The grand finale of the French-British imperial struggle was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Seven Years' War</span> (1756-63), which drew in most of Europe and was fought throughout much of the world. (The New World portion of this conflict is also known as the <strong>French and Indian War</strong>.) Britain won this war, thereby seizing the territory of New France and securing <strong>dominance</strong> of North America.</p>

</div>

<p>Victory came with two major responsibilities, however: the repayment of a massive <strong>national debt</strong> incurred from the war, and the <strong>military protection</strong> of Britain's vast American territory. In response, <strong>British authority</strong> over the colonies was tightened. Restrictions were imposed on <strong>westward expansion</strong>, new <strong>taxes</strong> were introduced, and some colonies were <strong>transferred</strong> to direct monarchical control.<span class="super">A323-24,5</span></p>

<p>These imperial decisions were met with widespread <strong>colonial resentment</strong>, leading many Americans to speak out against being controlled and taxed by a government in which they lacked <strong>representation</strong>. They also began to question the necessity of British political and military protection, given that the <strong>French threat</strong> on the western frontier had been eliminated. The most famous act of dissent was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Boston Tea Party</span>, in which patriots tossed boxes of tea (which had just arrived in British ships) overboard; this was a protest against tax on tea and trade regulations that favoured British imports of tea (over that of domestic producers).<span class="super">A323-24,5,7,10</span></p>

<h3>Birth of the United States</h3>

<p>As unrest mounted, the colonies prepared for battle. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Continental Army</span> was organized as the main force to fight the British, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">George Washington</span>, a Virginian plantation-owner who had served as a British officer in the French and Indian War, was chosen to command it. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">American Revolution</span> (1775-83) broke out when a British attempt to suppress rebels in Massachusetts met with fierce resistance.<span class="super">6,9</span></p>

<p>Revolutionary America consisted of <strong>thirteen colonies</strong> along the eastern coast. These colonies officially proclaimed their sovereignty on July 4, 1776, via the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Declaration of Independence</span>.<span class="super">5</span></p>

<p>While colonial determination and Washington's tactical genius contributed much to American victory, so did the Americans' <strong>home advantage</strong>, in terms of both familiar terrain (which was largely unmapped) and proximity to troops and supplies. Also crucial was the military assistance of Britain's <strong>imperial rivals</strong>, namely France, Spain, and the Netherlands.<span class="super">A325-26,6</span></p>

<p>The war can be divided into two theatres. In the <strong>land theatre</strong>, battles were fought throughout the Thirteen Colonies, leading ultimately to the defeat of British land forces. Likewise, in the <strong>sea theatre</strong>, the British fleet was eventually repelled from the American coast. The peace treaty that ended the war acknowledged the <strong>independence</strong> of the Thirteen Colonies (and restored Spanish ownership of Florida).<span class="super">A325-26,6</span></p>

<p>American independence was not a smooth transition, however; for decades, <strong>regional rebellions</strong> threatened to tear the country apart. Fortunately, these were successfully <strong>contained</strong>, and national unity would not be threatened again until the Civil War.<span class="super">A325-26,6</span></p>

<p>As noted earlier, British culture is the <strong>foundation</strong> of American culture. This simple fact is of enormous historical importance, given that the United States inherited the British institutions of strong <strong>representative government</strong> and <strong>liberalism</strong> (as opposed to the absolutism inherited by French and Latin American colonies). Yet even in Britain, representative government was still far from reaching its potential, in terms of both <strong>governing power</strong> (which was shared with the monarch) and <strong>suffrage</strong> (which was limited to a wealthy few).<span class="super">A325-26</span></p>

<p>In the United States, representative government was set free from <strong>monarchical interference</strong>. Moreover,  <strong>suffrage</strong> was gradually extended, such that America became the first country to eliminate class-based restrictions from voting. The United States is consequently widely considered the world's first true <strong>democracy</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/democracy">History of Democracy</a>).<span class="super">A325-26</span></p>

<p>The original American <strong>system of government</strong>, which lasted until 1789, featured a weak federal government. This was a deliberate choice, driven by revolutionary desire to free the colonies from any <strong>centralized control</strong>. As it became clear that federal impotence was hindering American unity and progress, however, a new federal government was formed, with greatly <strong>expanded powers</strong> (including taxation, international diplomacy, and national defence).<span class="super">A325-26,K298-99,5</span></p>

<p>The new government was drawn up in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">United States Constitution</span>, which came into effect in 1789.<span class="super">5</span> (A <strong>constitution</strong> is a body of law that describes how a nation is to be governed.)</p>

<p>The freshly independent United States embarked on a long phase of <strong>westward expansion</strong>. This territorial growth was often proclaimed as the nation's <strong>manifest destiny</strong> (i.e. "self-evident destiny"), a notion consistently invoked to justify violence against Native Americans and other colonial powers.<span class="super">A373,5</span></p>

<p>The <strong>age of expansion</strong> (ca. 1776-1865) featured three especially notable presidents. The first is <strong>George Washington</strong>, elected the first president of the United States in 1789.</p>

<p>The second is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thomas Jefferson</span>, third president and chief author of the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson conducted the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Louisiana Purchase</span>, in which America bought a vast territory (spanning roughly a quarter of the contiguous US) from France.<span class="super">11</span> (Napoleon had won this territory for France from Spain.)</p>

<p>The third is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abraham Lincoln</span>, who averted the bifurcation of America by leading the North to victory in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Civil War</span> (1861-65). This conflict, which focused largely on the federal abolition of <strong>slavery</strong> (which the South opposed), began with the South's proclamation of <strong>secession</strong> from the United States (as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Confederate States of America</span>, or simply "the Confederacy"). Slavery was central to the Southern economy, which relied heavily on <strong>plantation crops</strong>.<span class="super">A375-76,5</span></p>

<p>No conflict has yet surpassed the Civil War in terms of American <strong>casualties</strong>, which numbered in the hundreds of thousands. As in all pre-World War conflicts, <strong>disease</strong> (from unsanitary conditions) was the primary killer. Many of the fallen were <strong>emancipated slaves</strong> who chose to fight for the North.<span class="super">A377-78,K314-15</span></p>

<p>The North, which held the advantage in terms of both <strong>population</strong> and <strong>industrialization</strong>, eventually claimed victory in the Civil War. American reunification was enabled by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reconstruction</span>, a painstaking process of Southern economic and political reorganization. Though Southern African-Americans obtained full citizenship, grievous <strong>oppression</strong> persisted.<span class="super">A377-78,K314-15,5</span></p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>During the <strong>age of industrialization</strong> (ca. 1865-1914), booming American <strong>industries</strong> (notably steel and oil) developed, and population growth surged as European <strong>immigration</strong> peaked. The nation was connected by the <strong>transnational railroad</strong>, and an overseas "American empire" was amassed, including <strong>Alaska</strong> and various <strong>island territories</strong> in the Pacific (e.g. Hawaii, Samoa, Guam, Philippines) and Caribbean (e.g. Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands). Overseas territories were vital for <strong>resupplying</strong> American naval, merchant, and whaling vessels. Imperialism in the Pacific region was also extended <strong>economically</strong>, in the form of lopsided trade agreements with China and Japan.<span class="super">A379-80,5</span></p>

<p>The primary American conflict of the "age of industrialization" was the <strong>Spanish-American War</strong>, in which Spain lost the final traces of its empire to the United States. The largest component was the <strong>Philippines</strong>, which descended into political turmoil, eventually (after WWII) attaining independence.<span class="super">A380</span></p>

<p>As the overwhelmingly dominant power of the New World, American <strong>interference</strong> in Central and South American affairs was inevitable. The foremost example during the "age of industrialization" was the fomentation of a local revolution in <strong>Columbia</strong>, which had refused to allow American construction of a canal that would connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Via this revolution, a piece of Columbia seceded to form the independent nation of <strong>Panama</strong>, which (in return for American support) approved the canal.<span class="super">A381</span></p>

<p>The United States remained neutral in <strong>World War I</strong> until 1917, when German attacks on American merchant vessels compelled a defensive response (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/world-war-i">World War I</a>).</p>

<p>The subsequent <strong>interwar</strong> period featured two phases. The booming 1920s witnessed the rise of true <strong>mass production</strong>, bringing a wide range of factory-made goods to the general population. (The phenomenon of mass production/consumption of goods is often dubbed <strong>consumerism</strong>; thus, consumerism was born in the 1920s.) The 1930s, on the other hand, were dominated by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Great Depression</span>, in which many thousands lost their jobs, homes, and savings.<span class="super">5</span></p>

<p>This economic disaster contributed to the landslide victory of Democrat <span style="font-weight: bold;">Franklin D. Roosevelt</span>, whose anti-depression policies are known collectively as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">New Deal</span>.<span class="super">5</span> These policies included mortgage relief, student grants, unemployment benefits, workers' rights (e.g. union and collective bargaining rights, maximum working hours and minimum wages), and tightened financial regulations.<span class="super">A452,K384-85,13</span></p>

<p>The New Deal reflects the political philosophy of <span style="font-weight: bold;">positive liberalism</span>, which asserts that government should provide citizens with a <strong>minimum standard of welfare</strong> in order to ensure they can fully exercise their freedoms (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/western-philosophy">History of Western Philosophy</a>). A nation that strives to achieve positive liberalism is known as a <strong>welfare state</strong>.<span class="super">13</span></p>

<p>The New Deal helped protect America's <strong>democracy</strong>. In Europe, the suffering of the Great Depression fuelled many <strong>dictatorships</strong>, including those of Germany, Italy, Spain, and Portugal. European nations that averted dictatorship did so largely by adopting <strong>welfare-state policies</strong>; thus, the rise of the welfare state was not American-led, but rather a broad international movement throughout the West.<span class="super">A452,13</span></p>

<p>Joint international progress was also achieved in <span style="font-weight: bold;">civil rights</span>, which can be defined as "the rights of all people to freedom and equality". Though progress in civil rights can be traced back many centuries, the pace increased rapidly in the twentieth century, with many forms of <strong>legal discrimination</strong> (based on such characteristics as gender, ethnicity, and sexuality) finally being eliminated.</p>

<p>While the United States initially abstained from entering <strong>World War II</strong>, Roosevelt eventually began to support Britain and Russia by lending funds and leasing military equipment. Then, with the Japanese attack on <strong>Pearl Harbor</strong> in December 1941, America joined the Allies (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/world-war-ii">World War II</a>).<span class="super">5</span></p>

<p>The <strong>manufacturing boom</strong> of the Second World War propelled the American economy to staggering new heights. By war's end, the United States was responsible for well <strong>over half</strong> of global manufacturing, driven largely by government spending.<span class="super">A492,K418-19</span></p>

<p>The <strong>Cold War</strong> (ca. 1945-91) featured two global superpowers: the US and USSR. The war was "cold" in that direct American-Russian combat was avoided, given the likelihood of <strong>mutual destruction</strong> by nuclear weapons. Instead, the war consisted of a struggle for <strong>global influence</strong>, with each side disseminating propaganda and aiding national regimes in exchange for allegiance (and imposing sanctions on hostile regimes). Military operations were limited to <strong>regional struggles</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/cold-war">Cold War</a>).</p>

<div class="slider-single">

</div>

<p>The first Cold War president was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Harry Truman</span>, who formulated the policy of "containing" communism by supporting at-risk nations rather than by toppling existing communist regimes; this stance became known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Truman Doctrine</span>. (Note that the so-called "communist" nations of the world have actually been socialist dictatorships; see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/marxism">Marxism</a>.) Truman also oversaw the formation of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</span> (a Western military alliance) and implemented the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Marshall Plan</span> (which provided loans for the reconstruction of Europe).<span class="super">5</span></p>

<p>The Cold War can be divided into <strong>three phases</strong> according to the degree of strain on Russian-American relations: an initial period of soaring <strong>tension</strong> (ca. WWII-1970), a temporary <strong>relaxation</strong> (the 1970s), and a final <strong>resurgence</strong> (ca. 1980-91). The final phase ended with a sudden <strong>dissipation</strong> of tension (including large weapons-reduction agreements), followed by the <strong>collapse</strong> of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The period ca. 1945-70 was the most unstable and bloody phase of the Cold War. These years witnessed the development of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">hydrogen bomb</span> (which remains the most powerful weapon on Earth), as well as <span style="font-weight: bold;">intercontinental ballistic missiles</span> (ICBMs), which can deliver bombs to any target worldwide. The primary American military engagements of the Cold War, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Korean War</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vietnam War</span>, raged.</p>

<p>This period also featured the <strong>space race</strong>, in which Russia and America competed in the field of space aeronautics and exploration. Four primary milestones may be identified. The "race" opened with the Russian launch of the first artificial <strong>satellite</strong>, Sputnik, in 1957. This was followed by the first <strong>manmade object on the moon</strong> (the crash-landed Luna 2 probe, in 1959) and the first <strong>human in space</strong> (Yuri Gagarin, in 1961), both Russian. The space race concluded with the first <strong>human moon landing</strong>, achieved by the United States in 1969.</p>

<p>Fears of <strong>communist infiltration</strong> of government and media fuelled <strong>aggressive investigation</strong> of American citizens, sometimes leading to imprisonment (or even, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, execution).<span class="super">5</span> This campaign of suspicion and terror is known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">McCarthyism</span>, after one of its foremost proponents, Senator Joseph McCarthy.</p>

<p>Cold War tension culminated with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cuban Missile Crisis</span>, the outstanding challenge faced by President <span style="font-weight: bold;">John F. Kennedy</span>. Prior to Kennedy's presidency, a communist coup led by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fidel Castro</span> had ousted the US-backed Cuban government. In response, the US developed a plan to topple Castro by sending a small force (composed of some thousand CIA-trained Cuban exiles) to incite a <strong>counter-revolution</strong>.</p>

<p>The operation, known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bay of Pigs Invasion</span> (the Bay of Pigs lies on Cuba's southern coast), was executed under Kennedy's administration.  The operation <strong>failed</strong> miserably: the exiles were quickly defeated by the Cuban army, and no revolution occurred.<span class="super">16</span></p>

<p>In 1962, it was discovered that Soviet <strong>nuclear missile sites</strong> had been constructed in Cuba.<span class="super">20</span> Kennedy ordered a <strong>naval blockade</strong> of the island, and for several days the world teetered on the edge of nuclear war. An <strong>agreement</strong> was finally reached, however, in which Khrushchev withdrew the weapons from Cuba in exchange for the American withdrawal of nuclear missiles in Turkey, as well as a guarantee against future American invasion of Cuba.<span class="super">21</span></p>

<p>Economically speaking, the period ca. 1945-70 witnessed consistently high levels of <strong>growth and employment</strong> across much of the world (especially the Western world and East Asia), even in nations which had suffered heavy wartime destruction (notably Germany and Japan).<span class="super">22</span> Consequently, this period is often dubbed the "golden age of capitalism".</p>

<p>1960s America witnessed the birth of <strong>youth culture</strong>, in which young people cultivated a distinct lifestyle, including vocabulary, music, and fashion. Only since the 1960s has society featured a <strong>generation gap</strong>: a sharp cultural distinction between parents and children.<span class="super">H1093,K428-29</span></p>

<p>The 1970s was a period of <span style="font-weight: bold;">détente</span> (relaxing of tensions). Forces were gradually withdrawn from Vietnam under <span style="font-weight: bold;">Richard Nixon</span>, who argued that other nations must assume primary responsibility for defending themselves from communism (a position known as the "Nixon Doctrine"). The 1970s also witnessed a major <strong>global economic slowdown</strong>, due largely to OPEC price-setting (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/energy-crisis">Energy Crisis</a>). Since oil is a <strong>fundamental input</strong> of industrialized economies, a sharp rise in oil prices imposed a major economic burden.<span class="super">5</span></p>

<p>The 1980s experienced a renewal of Russian-American <strong>tensions</strong>. Most of the decade was spanned by the presidency of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ronald Reagan</span>, who took a hard stance on the Cold War in terms of both rhetoric and policy. Defence spending soared, various military operations were launched (notably in the Middle East), and renewed sanctions were effected on unfriendly regimes.<span class="super">5,23</span></p>

<p>Reagan also ushered in a new era of conservative social policy by embracing <span style="font-weight: bold;">supply-side economics</span>, which asserts that economic growth is driven primarily by the supply of goods and labour in an economy; growth is thus best promoted by encouraging companies to produce and people to work. <strong>Production</strong> is boosted through policies that reduce the costs of running a business, including lower corporate taxes, relaxed business regulations, and weaker unions. The size of the <strong>workforce</strong> is boosted by reducing unemployment insurance and other forms of social security.<span class="super">23</span></p>

<p>Supply-side economics is sometimes called <strong>trickle-down economics</strong>, as proponents have argued that the resulting total gain in wealth will ultimately find its way into the pockets of the middle and working classes. This is a controversial theory. While the 1980s did experience the return of strong economic growth, opponents have argued that the <strong>welfare gap</strong> between the upper and middle/lower classes widened.<span class="super">23</span></p>

<p>Russian-American relations thawed in the late 1980s, allowing Reagan to conclude several major <strong>weapons-reduction agreements</strong> with Gorbachev. The Cold War finally ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union during the tenure of <span style="font-weight: bold;">George H. W. Bush</span>, whose presidency is known for success abroad but a recession at home (which contributed to Clinton's victory over Bush in the next election). Bush's policies were generally similar to those of his predecessor.<span class="super">5,17,30</span></p>

<p>His most prominent international effort was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Persian Gulf War</span> (1990-91), which consisted of two major operations in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. First was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Operation Desert Shield</span>, which featured an air/sea blockade of Iraq and the deployment of troops to bases in Saudi Arabia. When Iraq refused to withdraw, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Operation Desert Storm</span> ensued, in which Kuwait was liberated within days through a combination of land, air, and sea attacks.<span class="super">5</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bill Clinton</span> oversaw the longest period of continuous <strong>economic expansion</strong> in US history. As the first post-Cold War president, Clinton was widely perceived as bearing the responsibility of constructing an enduring <strong>global peace</strong>.<span class="super">4</span> His efforts in this regard included peace talks in <strong>Southwest Asia</strong>, as well as military operations in the <strong>Balkans</strong> (where conflicts had erupted among the splinter states of Yugoslavia) and <strong>Haiti</strong> (where the US restored the Haitian government to power following a coup). In <strong>Iraq</strong>, airstrikes were launched on oil refineries and military targets due to Saddam Hussein's refusal to cooperate with UN weapons inspections.<span class="super">19</span></p>

<p>Clinton was succeeded by <span style="font-weight: bold;">George W. Bush</span> (son of George H. W.) who, during his first year in office, witnessed the bloodiest terrorist attack in history. On <strong>September 11</strong>, 2001, nineteen terrorists (mainly from Saudi Arabia) hijacked four domestic US flights. Three planes were deliberately crashed into buildings (one into each tower of the World Trade Centre in New York, and one into the Pentagon), while the fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania (after its passengers revolted).<span class="super">37</span></p>

<p>9/11, in which nearly three thousand people were killed, sent <strong>terrorism</strong> to the top of the international policy agenda. First priority was given to the destruction of <span style="font-weight: bold;">al-Qaeda</span>, the Afghanistan-based international terrorist organization (led by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Osama bin Laden</span>) which had orchestrated the attacks. When US demands for the Afghan government (a dictatorship known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Taliban</span>) to dismantle al-Qaeda and extradite bin Laden were ignored, a US-led invasion of Afghanistan ensued. Though both the Taliban and al-Qaeda were driven into hiding within a year, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">War in Afghanistan</span> (2001-) continues, as coalition forces attempt to establish a stable democracy while fending off guerrillas.<span class="super">5</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, suspicion mounted over Saddam Hussein's alleged development of <strong>weapons of mass destruction</strong> (WMDs). His persistent refusal to cooperate with UN inspectors eventually sparked the <strong>Iraq War</strong> (2003-11), initiated by the US and UK (without UN approval). Accusations of WMD development proved false.<span class="super">5,27</span></p>

<p>Bush's second term witnessed one of the worst economic crises in history, known simply as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">financial crisis</span> (2007-present). A "financial crisis" is essentially when something that is <strong>financially valuable</strong> (e.g. cash, bank accounts, stock market shares, loans) suddenly loses much of its value, resulting in the impoverishment of individuals, businesses, and/or governments. A financial crisis is considered to have ended once losses have been recovered.</p>

<p>The subsequent recession contributed to the election victory of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Barack Obama</span>, who injected the economy with a massive <strong>stimulus package</strong>, including bailouts for banks and auto manufacturers. On the international scene, Obama withdrew the last American troops from <strong>Iraq</strong> in 2011, and has greatly scaled back troops in <strong>Afghanistan</strong>.<span class="super">5,28</span></p>
