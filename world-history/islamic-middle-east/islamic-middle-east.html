<h3>Geography</h3>

<p>The term <strong>Middle East</strong> typically denotes Southwest and Central Asia; often, North Africa is included as well. The predominant ecosystems of the Middle East are <strong>desert</strong> and <strong>dry grassland</strong> (see <a href="../../history-supplementary/climates-biomes.html">Climates and Biomes</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>Southwest Asia can be divided into six parts: <strong>Asia Minor</strong> (the Asian part of Turkey), <strong>South <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggcauc04&word=Caucasia&text=\k%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3Eo%CC%87%3C%2Fspan%3E-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ek%C4%81-zh%C9%99%2C%20-sh%C9%99\">Caucasia</a></strong> (Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan), <strong>Iraq</strong>, <strong>Iran</strong>, <strong>Arabia</strong>, and the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=levant01&word=levant&text=\l%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Evant\">Levant</a> (the region covered by Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan). North Africa can be divided into <strong>Egypt</strong> and the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggmagh05&word=Maghrib&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Em%C3%A4-gr%C9%99b\">Maghreb</a> (the Mediterranean African nations west of Egypt).</p>

</div>

<p>The term <strong>Caucasia</strong> denotes the region between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It can be divided into <strong>North Caucasia</strong> (which lies in Russia) and <strong>South Caucasia</strong> (which consists of Georgia, <a class="tip" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggarme01&word=Armenia&text=\%C3%A4r-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Em%C4%93-n%C4%93-%C9%99%2C%20-ny%C9%99\">Armenia</a>, and <a class="tip" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggazer01&word=Azerbaijan&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Ea-z%C9%99r-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eb%C4%AB-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ej%C3%A4n%2C%20%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3E%C3%A4-\">Azerbaijan</a>). The region of Caucasia is also known as "the Caucasus".</p>

<p>The historic region of <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggmeso03&word=Mesopotamia&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eme-s%28%C9%99-%29p%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Et%C4%81-m%C4%93-%C9%99%2C%20-my%C9%99\">Mesopotamia</a> is roughly equivalent to modern Iraq. <strong>Palestine</strong> encompasses the region of modern Israel and the Palestinian Territories. Palestine is sometimes referred to as Canaan or "the Holy Land".</p>

<p>Throughout Essential Humanities, the term <strong>Central Asia</strong> denotes all of the -stan nations except Pakistan (which is grouped with South Asia). One key region of Central Asia is <strong>northern Kazakhstan</strong>, whose climate is relatively wet (compared with most of the Middle East), giving rise to vast plains of <strong>wet grassland</strong>. Indeed, northern Kazakhstan forms part of the vast <strong>Eurasian Steppe</strong>, whose endless grassland set the region on a unique historical path (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/world-history/steppe">History of the Steppe</a>).</p>

<p>Throughout antiquity, the land of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Arabia</span> was relatively quiet and isolated. Its inhabitants, the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Arabs</span>, spoke the language of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Arabic</span>. Though civilization did emerge here (having diffused southward from Mesopotamia), urbanization was light, with much of the Arabian population retaining a nomadic lifestyle of herding and trading.<span class="super">K174-75</span></p>

<p>While vast empires rose and fell to the north, Arabia remained a patchwork of <strong>small kingdoms</strong>, whose economies were based largely on the trade of <span style="font-weight: bold;">spices</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">resins</span> produced in southern Arabia.<span class="super">A161</span> (Resin is a sticky substance secreted by plants; certain resins were extremely valuable as ingredients for perfume and incense.)</p>

<p>In the early seventh century, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Muhammad</span>, a merchant who lived in the city of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mecca</span>, founded the religion of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Islam</span>. Though he gained many followers, he also met with violent resistance, forcing him to flee to <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=medina01&word=medina&text=\m%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ed%C4%93-n%C9%99\">Medina</a>. Seizing this city as his capital, Muhammad founded a theocratic Islamic state and led its expansion across the Arabian peninsula.<span class="super">22</span></p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rashidun period</span> consists of the first four caliphs (<a class="tip" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=bixabu03&word=Abu%20Bakr&text=\%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eb%C3%BC-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Eba-k%C9%99r\">Abu Bakr</a>, Umar, Uthman, and Ali), who were elected by elders of the Muslim community. This period witnessed the rapid expansion of the Caliphate beyond Arabia, across Southwest Asia and into North Africa. The defeat of the <strong>Second Persian Empire</strong> (ca. 650) marks the rise of the Caliphate as the new superpower of Southwest Asia.<span class="super">17</span> The <strong>Persians</strong> gradually embraced Islam, such that Persia became part of the Islamic world.</p>

</div>

<p>The Rashidun caliphs were succeeded by two long hereditary dynasties.</p>

<p>The expansionary phase of the Caliphate was completed by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Umayyad dynasty</span>, which moved the Islamic capital from Medina to <strong>Damascus</strong>.<span class="super">17</span> Under the Umayyads, the Caliphate expanded both westward (across North Africa and into Iberia) and eastward (across southern Central Asia and Pakistan). Heavy Arab settlement ensued across North Africa, causing much of the region's indigenous people (<strong>Berbers</strong> in the Maghreb, <strong>Egyptians</strong> in Egypt) to convert to Islam, adopt the Arabic language, and intermarry. <strong>Christianity</strong> in North Africa (which had been firmly established by the Roman Empire) was extinguished everywhere except Egypt, where a Christian minority (the Coptic Church) persisted.<span class="super">A258</span></p>

<p>Following a Caliphate civil war, the Umayyads were supplanted by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abbasid dynasty</span>, which ruled from <strong>Baghdad</strong>. Officially, the Abbasids ruled the Caliphate for the period ca. 750-1250. This period is also known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Islamic golden age</span>, during which art and scholarship flourished with exceptional brilliance throughout Muslim lands (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/world-art/islamic">Islamic Art</a>).</p>

<p>In reality, however, the Caliphate <strong>fractured</strong> into smaller states long before 1250. The period during which the Caliphate existed as a <strong>united empire</strong> may be approximated as ca. 650-900.<span class="super">48</span> The period ca. 900-present may therefore be described as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">fractured Islamic world</span>.</p>

<p>The Islamic world can be divided into two main <strong>cultural branches</strong>: Arabian and Persianate. The <strong>Arabian</strong> branch (the original type of Islamic civilization) spread from its homeland of Arabia across much of Southwest Asia and northern Africa. The <strong>Persianate</strong> branch, which resulted from the melding of Islamic and Persian culture, emerged in Iran and radiated to the west, north, and east.</p>

<div class="slider-single">
<img class="slider-image-multi" src="../../img/art/islamic-culture-branches-arabic-persianate.png" alt="The Islamic World" data-credit="Essential Humanities">
</div>

<p>As illustrated in the above map, <strong>Arabian branch</strong> carried Islamic civilization further into the African continent than it did the Arabic language; while most nations of the Arabian branch are Arabic-speaking (plain red), many are not (red with white dots). Likewise, while the core nations of the <strong>Persianate branch</strong> are Persian-speaking (plain dark green), others are Turkic-speaking (dark green with white dots). When Persianate culture spread beyond the Middle East (light green), it merged with <strong>preexisting civilizations</strong> (especially Indian civilization, in South and Southeast Asia), such that these regions belong less firmly to the Persianate world.</p>

<p>The <strong>Turkic peoples</strong> originated in the Eurasian Steppe (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/world-history/steppe">History of the Steppe</a>). They were a minor presence until the <strong>Turkic age</strong> of the Steppe (ca. 500-1200), when a patchwork of Turkic empires emerged and dominated the region. This period also witnessed a great <strong>migration</strong> of Turkic peoples into Central Asia.</p>

<p>So long as the Caliphate remained united, the Turkic tribes were <strong>halted</strong> at its borders, and thus could not advance into southern Central Asia. In the meantime, they absorbed <strong>Persianate culture</strong>, including the Islamic religion. With the crumbling of the Caliphate ca. 900, the tribes could no longer be checked; a massive <strong>invasion</strong> ensued, as they swept across southern Central Asia and Iran (and beyond).<span class="super">A173</span></p>

<p>During the period ca. 900-1300, the destinies of Southwest Asia and North Africa diverged sharply. While <strong>Southwest Asia</strong> experienced a massive invasion of Turkic tribes, this invasion did not reach <strong>North Africa</strong>, which continued to be governed by its post-Caliphate patchwork of Arabic states.</p>

<p>In Southwest Asia, the invasion ultimately gave rise to the first Turkic Islamic state: the <strong><a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=seljuk01&word=Seljuk&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Esel-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Ej%C3%BCk%2C%20sel-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3E\">Seljuq</a> Empire</strong>, which lasted over a century. Based in Iran, this empire stretched eastward across Central Asia and westward to Anatolia; indeed, it was the Seljuq Empire that converted Anatolia to Islam.<span class="super">A173</span> The threat of this empire to the Byzantines was a key factor in sparking the <strong>Crusades</strong>.</p>

<div class="slider-single">
<img class="slider-image-multi" src="../../img/history/seljuq.jpg" alt="Seljuq Empire" data-credit="<a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seljuk_Empire_locator_map.svg&quot;>MapMaster</a>">
</div>

<p>Back at the Steppe, the Turkic age (ca. 500-1200) was succeeded by the <strong>Mongol Empire</strong> (ca. 1200-1300), which expanded across the entire Steppe and vast regions to the south, including half of the Islamic world. The Seljuq Empire had crumbled by this time, allowing the Mongols to invade Southwest Asia with relative ease. They terminated the tradition of figurehead caliphs, thus bringing the Abbasid dynasty to an official close. The Mongol Empire itself crumbled ca. 1300, leaving behind a patchwork of <strong>splinter states</strong>.</p>

<div class="slider-single">

</div>

<p>By this time, the Islamic world had achieved tremendous ethnic diversity. The <strong>Arabian branch</strong> had witnessed the mingling of Arab invaders with various indigenous peoples, while the turmoil of the <strong>Persianate</strong> branch gave rise to a rich blend of Iranian, Turkic, and Mongolic peoples. Over the ensuing centuries, kingdoms and empires rose and fell among this tapestry, ultimately yielding the <strong>modern nations</strong> of the Middle East.</p>

<p>One nation to rise from the ashes of the Mongol Empire was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Turkey</span>, formed in Anatolia by a Turkic tribe known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ottomans</span>. The expansion of this state resulted in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ottoman Empire</span> (ca. 1300-WWI), which became the superpower of the early modern Middle East. The other leading early modern Islamic powers were <strong>Egypt</strong> (which the Ottoman Empire conquered for several centuries), <strong>Iran</strong> (where the Persian language weathered the Turkic and Mongol conquests), and the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.howjsay.com/index.php?word=mughal">Mughal</a> <strong>Empire</strong> (which governed most of South Asia).</p>

<h3>Modern Age</h3>

<p>In the Modern age (ca. 1800-present), the politics of the Middle East were dramatically reshaped by the dominant <strong>global powers</strong> (i.e. the primary European powers and the United States). Most of Central Asia was conquered by <strong>Russia</strong>, while <strong>Britain</strong> seized the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. North African territory was taken by Britain, <strong>France</strong>, and <strong>Italy</strong>.<span class="super">4,6</span></p>

</div>

<p>Since World War II, Middle Eastern politics have been dominated by <strong>Islamic fundamentalism</strong>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Arab-Israeli conflict</span>, and the region's massive <span style="font-weight: bold;">oil reserves</span>. The first two of these issues are discussed below. The oil reserves issue has two major consequences: <strong>domestic instability</strong> (due to the vastly unequal distribution of wealth that tends to emerge in oil-rich nations) and <strong>imperial interference</strong> (mostly by Western powers).<span class="super">4</span></p>

<h3>Islamic Fundamentalism</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fundamentalism</span> is the strict application of religious doctrine. Although fundamentalist movements can emerge within any religion, the term usually refers to Christianity or Islam. Such movements have often spurred terrible <strong>violence</strong> (e.g. the execution of heretics, the waging of "holy" war, terrorism) and given rise to <strong>theocracies</strong> (states governed by religious figures and institutions, with laws based on religious doctrine).</p>

<p>Fundamentalism has been a common reaction of the modern Islamic world against the global dominance of Western culture. This dominance includes modern technology, popular culture, democracy, and secularism (absence of religion) in government, law, and education. The spread of Western ways across the world is known as <strong>Westernization</strong>.</p>

<p>Resistance to Westernization is understandable. While the features listed above emerged gradually in the Western world, they have been thrust quite suddenly upon most of humanity, transforming non-Western societies so rapidly that many fear for the survival of their <strong>traditional cultures</strong>. Moreover, given that these societies have often experienced horrific <strong>mistreatment</strong> at imperial Western hands, it is unsurprising that Westernization is often perceived as a path to spiritual ruin.<span class="super">K358-59</span></p>

<p>Two major positions on Westernization emerged in the Islamic world. The <strong>moderate</strong> view argued that Islam would not be harmed by the separation of religion and state, and thus could coexist with Western ways (including democracy and secularism).<span class="super">K358-59</span> One of the most influential proponents of this view was the <strong>Young Turks</strong>, a group of political activists who transformed the crumbling Ottoman Empire into modern Turkey.</p>

<p>The <strong>fundamentalist</strong> view, on the other hand, argued that Western imperialism (often framed as "Christian imperialism") over Muslim lands had been enabled by insufficiently strict adherence to Islamic doctrine. According to this position, the only path forward is the rigid imposition of fundamentalist society, including <strong>theocratic government</strong> and <strong>Islamic law</strong> (aka sharia law). Fundamentalist regimes in the modern Islamic world have typically been oppressive, especially toward women and minority groups.<span class="super">K358-59</span></p>

<p>As noted earlier, resentment of Westernization often sprang from the violent manner of its arrival. Throughout the modern age, oil-thirsty Western nations (especially the US, Britain, and France) conspired in the overthrow of numerous hostile Islamic governments and the installation of <strong>puppet regimes</strong>, which were often brutally oppressive. It was therefore politically advantageous for the powerful <strong>upper classes</strong> of Islamic nations to adopt a modernist, pro-Western stance, which further encouraged fundamentalism among the oppressed <strong>lower classes</strong>.<span class="super">K442-43</span></p>

<h3>Arab-Israeli Conflict</h3>

<p>With the fall of the <strong>Ottoman Empire</strong> after World War I, several of its former regions were transferred to European control. Specifically, <strong>France</strong> took control of Syria and Lebanon, while <strong>Britain</strong> took Iraq and Palestine. Britain was thus responsible for managing the <strong>Jewish resettlement</strong> of Palestine, which had been ongoing since the late nineteenth century (largely via Jewish emigration from Europe due to persecution).<span class="super">11</span></p>

<p>The view that Jews ought to have their own state in Palestine is known as <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=zionis01&word=Zionism&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Ez%C4%AB-%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eni-z%C9%99m\">Zionism</a>. British attempts to secure Jewish-Arab agreement on the <strong>borders</strong> of this proposed state proved unsuccessful, however, as did those of the UN (which eventually intervened). The Jewish state of <strong>Israel</strong> was finally officially established after the Second World War, without Arab recognition.<span class="super">4,33</span></p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Arab-Israeli conflict</span> is a fluctuating level of hostilities between Israel and its neighbours, stretching from shortly after WWII up to the present day. The most significant episode of these hostilities (in terms of creating the present situation) is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Six-Day War</span>, fought in the 1960s between Israel and an alliance of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. The end result was significant territorial gains for Israel, namely the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=ggsina01&word=Sinai&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Es%C4%AB-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3En%C4%AB%20%3Cem%3Ealso%3C%2Fem%3E%20-n%C4%93-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3E%C4%AB\">Sinai</a> <strong>Peninsula</strong> and <strong>Gaza Strip</strong> (from Egypt), the <strong>West Bank</strong> (from Jordan), and the <strong>Golan Heights</strong> (from Syria).<span class="super">24</span></p>

<p>Although the eventual return of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt ended Israeli hostilities with that nation, conflict persists over the other three regions.<span class="super">4</span> The Gaza Strip and West Bank, both of which are predominantly Arab, are known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Palestinian Territories</span>. (As noted earlier, the region of <strong>Palestine</strong> consists of Israel, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank.)</p>

<p>The 1960s also witnessed the establishment of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Palestine Liberation Organization</span> (PLO), whose original goal was to oust the nation of Israel and unite Palestine as an Islamic state. With the Palestinian Territories as footholds, constant struggle with Israel ensued. Israel and the PLO finally recognized one another as legitimate political powers during the 1990s, following peace talks. These talks, known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Oslo Accords</span>, succeeded in making the 1990s an era of relative calm in the region.<span class="super">29</span></p>

</tbody></table>

<p>During the <strong>Cold War</strong> (ca. 1945-91), global politics took place in the shadow of two vast superpowers: <strong>America</strong> and the <strong>USSR</strong>. Most Islamic nations became politically aligned with one or the other, though some maintained neutrality. One of the foremost shifts of Cold War politics was the 1979 <span style="font-weight: bold;">Iranian Revolution</span>, which toppled the US-backed government and converted the nation to an Islamic theocracy (which it remains today).<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p>Another primary Cold War conflict took place in <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, which had come to feature a Soviet-backed government. An Afghan rebellion spurred the Russians to invade in support of this government, thus initiating the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Soviet War in Afghanistan</span> (1979-89). The war became a prolonged and bloody stalemate, as the Soviets (who controlled the cities) battled with various guerrilla forces (who held the mountainous countryside), which were funded by the US and other anti-Soviet allies.<span class="super">42</span> Among the guerrillas was the Saudi <span style="font-weight: bold;">Osama bin Laden</span>, who later founded the Afghanistan-based international terrorist organization <span style="font-weight: bold;">al-Qaeda</span>.<span class="super">38</span></p>

<p>When the Soviets finally withdrew, Afghanistan collapsed into years of civil strife between regional warlords. From this chaos emerged the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Taliban</span>, which united Afghanistan under its rule in the 1990s.<span class="super">42</span> During that same decade, various acts of <strong>terrorism</strong> attributed to al-Qaeda were executed, including the bombings of two American embassies in Africa. These acts, combined with the Taliban's oppression of the Afghan population, spurred UN <strong>sanctions</strong> against Afghanistan and American <strong>airstrikes</strong> on suspected terrorist camps.<span class="super">43</span></p>

<p>Following the <strong>9/11 attacks</strong> (carried out by al-Qaeda), the US demanded that the Taliban destroy al-Qaeda and extradite bin Laden.<span class="super">37,43</span> The Taliban's refusal prompted the US-led <strong>invasion of Afghanistan</strong>, in which the Taliban was swiftly toppled and driven (along with al-Qaeda) into hiding, although they have continued to fight as <strong>guerrillas</strong> from the countryside. A slow and difficult transition to <strong>democracy</strong> is ongoing.<span class="super">40</span> Meanwhile, after nearly a decade on the run, bin Laden was discovered hiding in Pakistan; in 2011, he was killed by American special forces.</p>

<p>Contemporary with the Soviet War in Afghanistan was a major conflict in Southwest Asia. Iraq, under the rule of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Saddam Hussein</span>, leapt upon the disorder of the Iranian Revolution as an opportunity to seize some of its neighbour's oil-rich territory. The resulting <span style="font-weight: bold;">Iraq-Iran War</span> (1980-88) amounted to yet another endless, bloody stalemate. Infamously, Saddam used poison gas against both Iranian forces and domestic Kurdish rebels.<span class="super">35,41</span></p>

<p>Having failed in Iran, Saddam tried annexing a much smaller neighbour: <strong>Kuwait</strong>. In the resulting <span style="font-weight: bold;">Persian Gulf War</span> (1990-91), a US-led coalition (which included Arab states) assembled in Saudi Arabia and sent <strong>airstrikes</strong> against the Iraqis. Saddam responded by firing missiles at Arab coalition members, as well as Israel. The war ended with a brief <strong>ground operation</strong> that drove the Iraqis from Kuwait.<span class="super">37,41</span></p>

<p>The Iraqi government, now massively unpopular, remained in power only through extreme brutality. It was also subject to UN embargo, on the grounds that Saddam might be developing <strong>weapons of mass destruction</strong> (chemical, biological, and/or nuclear). The embargo was only to be lifted if Iraq ceased any weapons development and cooperated fully with UN inspections on the matter. Since Saddam never complied with the latter condition, the embargo remained in place until the fall of his regime.<span class="super">37</span></p>

<p>As the 1990s drew on, increasing lack of Iraqi cooperation with the UN prompted <strong>airstrikes</strong> against military sites and oil plants.<span class="super">41</span> After 9/11, President Bush argued that although Iraq was not directly involved in the attack, the nation posed a major <strong>security threat</strong> given its suspected weapons programs and support for terrorist networks. While Britain shared the American view, the international community was divided on whether Iraq should be given more time to comply with UN demands. In 2003, the US and UK <strong>invaded Iraq</strong> and swiftly toppled Saddam's regime.<span class="super">41,44</span></p>

<p>Although coalition forces secured the nation's major cities, exiles of the old regime (augmented by other militant Islamic groups) continued to fight via <strong>guerrilla warfare</strong>. While the <strong>Iraq War</strong> (i.e. the occupation of Iraq) ended in 2011, the nation remains violent and politically fragile.<span class="super">41</span></p>
