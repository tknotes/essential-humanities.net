<h1>Religion</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><strong>Religion</strong>, which can be defined as "belief in the supernatural", has exerted a profound influence over every society throughout history. The span of this influence includes politics, law, education, festivals, customs, and behavioural norms. Historically, most people's <strong>day-to-day lives</strong> have been largely structured by religion. For much of the world, this continues to be true; the <strong>secular</strong> nature of modern Western society (in which religion is separate from political, legal, and education systems, and many people have little or no involvement with organized religion) is the exception.</p>

<p>Religion can be divided into <strong>two types</strong>: organized and unorganized. The beliefs and practices of an <span style="font-weight: bold;">organized religion</span> are governed by an official body, whereas such regulation is absent from <span style="font-weight: bold;">unorganized religion</span>. Consequently, adherents of an organized religion (e.g. Roman Catholicism) theoretically embrace a <strong>single system</strong> of beliefs and practices, while the beliefs and practices of unorganized religion (e.g. the religious traditions of West Africa) may <strong>vary considerably</strong> from region to region, while nonetheless sharing certain key elements.</p>

<p>Organized religions do tend to <strong>fracture</strong> over time, however, such that Christianity (for instance) consists of many <strong>branches</strong> (e.g. Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism). Thus, while Christianity is known as a "religion", it is really more a <strong>family of religions</strong> that share core beliefs.</p>

<p>Six <strong>major organized religions</strong> can be identified. Some are <span style="font-weight: bold;">monotheistic</span> (asserting the existence of a single deity), while others are <span style="font-weight: bold;">polytheistic</span> (multiple deities). <strong>Christianity</strong> and <strong>Islam</strong> are by far the largest (over a billion followers each), followed by <strong>Hinduism</strong> and <strong>Buddhism</strong> (hundreds of millions each). <strong>Sikhism</strong> has over twenty million adherents, while <strong>Judaism</strong> has over ten million.</p>

<p>Major alternatives to religion are <strong>atheism</strong> (the view that no deities exist) and <strong>agnosticism</strong> (the view that one cannot know whether any deities exist). Alternatives to traditional religion include <strong>deism</strong> (the view that the existence of deities can be proven logically) and <strong>transcendentalism</strong> (the view that the existence of deities can be known through intuition).</p>

<h3>Animism</h3>

<p>Religion (belief in the supernatural) dates at least to the <strong>Upper Paleolithic</strong> period (ca. 50,000-10,000 BC). The earliest form of religion was <strong>animism</strong>: the belief that physical things (e.g. objects, organisms, environmental features) are inhabited by spirits. Often, animistic societies believe that appropriate customs and ceremonies can summon <strong>aid</strong> from these spirits.<span class="super">K144-45</span></p>

<p>Animism was probably a <strong>universal feature</strong> of early human societies. Since animism generally only faded from regions that experienced <strong>urbanization</strong>, most of the world's religions (historical and present-day) can be grouped under the term "animism".<span class="super">13</span></p>

<p>Within animistic societies, certain people came to be recognized as having the ability to <strong>communicate</strong> with (and possibly influence) the spiritual realm. These people, often known as <strong>shamans</strong>, may enter trances (sometimes drug-induced) in order to conduct this communication. Shamans are often called upon to use their spiritual influence to <strong>heal</strong> wounds and diseases, or to read omens of the <strong>future</strong>.<span class="super">K32-33</span></p>

<p><strong>Ancestor worship</strong> is another common feature of animistic societies. This term denotes the belief that one's deceased predecessors continue to exist in <strong>spirit form</strong>, and that these spirits should be venerated. Like other kinds of spirits, ancestor spirits may be persuaded to <strong>assist</strong> the living.</p>

<p>A range of typical <strong>ceremony</strong> types emerged among animistic societies, including festivals at certain <strong>times of year</strong> (e.g. an astronomical event or the changing of a season), <strong>initiation</strong> of children into adulthood, <strong>fertility</strong> ceremonies, and ritualistic burial of the <strong>dead</strong>. Ceremonies might include such elements as music, dancing, reenactments (of historical or divine events), costumes, masks, material offerings, or sacrifices.</p>

<p>The tradition of <strong>ritualistic burial</strong> is of enormous importance for archaeologists. Not only do burial sites provide insight into the <strong>religious beliefs</strong> of long-vanished societies, they have also yielded a wealth of <strong>material goods</strong>, thanks to another common animistic practice: the burial of practical objects and riches along with the body, for use in the afterlife.<span class="super">K32-33</span></p>

<h3>Polytheism and Monotheism</h3>

<p>With the rise of <strong>agriculture</strong>, many humans shifted from hunting and gathering to a settled, farming-based life. As settlements grew into <strong>cities</strong>, tribal organization gave way to a tall political and social hierarchy, as well as extensive specialization of labour. Religion underwent an equivalent transformation, in which the innumerable spirits of animism were reduced to a much <strong>smaller number</strong> of supernatural beings (each typically associated with a particular city or aspect of nature/society) arranged in a <strong>hierarchy</strong>.<span class="super">K142-45</span></p>

<p>These beings are known as <strong>deities</strong> (aka gods), and this new type of religion is called <strong>polytheism</strong> (belief in multiple deities). Since these deities were so few in number (compared with the spirits of animism), they could be ascribed much more <strong>detailed attributes</strong>, including names, personalities, and histories. Like animistic spirits, these deities were often <strong>courted</strong> with religious customs and ceremonies. In some cases, <strong>human rulers</strong> were also recognized as deities.<span class="super">K142-45</span></p>

<p>Urbanization caused <strong>religious professionals</strong> to become much more organized and specialized. Whereas animism features shamans and an informal range of beliefs, urban societies gave rise to hierarchies of <strong>clergy</strong>, who gathered and sifted a society's beliefs into official <strong>doctrine</strong>. Thus did <strong>organized religion</strong> emerge.</p>

<p>Most urban societies became permanently <strong>polytheistic</strong>; only a few extended the reduction of spirits to <strong>monotheism</strong> (belief in a single deity).</p>

<h3>Indian Religions</h3>

<p>During the Vedic age (ca. 1500-500 BC), the prevailing belief system of India was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vedic religion</span>. In the final centuries of this period, the Vedic religion evolved into three new religions: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hinduism</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Buddhism</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jainism</span>. Much later, at the end of the medieval period, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Sikhism</span> splintered from Hinduism.<span class="super">9</span> These faiths comprise the four major religions of India.</p>

<p>Much belief is shared among the four religions, including the notions of <span style="font-weight: bold;">karma</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">continuous reincarnation</span>. (The seeds of these concepts are found in the Vedic religion.) Karma denotes the effect of one's <strong>conduct</strong> on one's reincarnation: the more virtuous the conduct, the more positive the effect.<span class="super">6</span> Consistent virtuous living eventually allows one to <strong>break free</strong> of the cycle of rebirth. Perhaps the most striking contrast among the Indian religions is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">caste system</span>, embraced by Hinduism but rejected by the others.</p>

<p>Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism are found mainly in <strong>India</strong>, while Buddhism is widely dispersed. Most of the world's Buddhists are found in the nations of <strong>East Asia</strong> and <strong>Indochina</strong> (mainland Southeast Asia), as well as a few <strong>South Asian</strong> countries (namely Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Nepal).</p>

<h3>Abrahamic Religions</h3>

<p>The three Abrahamic religions, which overlap significantly, all view <strong>Abraham</strong> as a crucial early figure in their religion (hence the term "Abrahamic").</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Judaism</span> asserts that a covenant (contract) was made between God and the Jews, his chosen people. This covenant requires the Jews to follow God's laws, most famously the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ten Commandments</span>. The chief body of Jewish scripture is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hebrew Bible</span>, which also serves as the Old Testament of the Christian Bible.<span class="super">1</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Christianity</span>, which splintered from Judaism in the early centuries AD, centres on the figure of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jesus</span>. According to Christians, Jesus (the son of God) died to save humanity from its sins, and belief in Jesus is the path to spiritual salvation. The central Christian scripture is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bible</span>, particularly the New Testament.<span class="super">3</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Islam</span> emerged in early seventh-century Arabia. Muslims believe that numerous messengers have been sent by God through the ages, including Abraham and Jesus. The last and most important of these messengers, however, is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Muhammad</span>.<span class="super">4</span> The central scripture of Islam is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Qur'an</span> (aka Koran).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Baha'i</span>, which emerged in nineteenth-century Iran, is sometimes also grouped as an Abrahamic religion. Although this faith has its own <strong>scripture</strong>, there are no Baha'i clergy or ceremonies. The Baha'i religion is rather primarily concerned with propagating a <strong>code of ethics</strong>, both individual (e.g. asceticism) and social (e.g. universal education). Baha'i also proclaims that all religions are correct, and describe the same spiritual truth.<span class="super">5</span></p>

<h3>East Asian Religions</h3>

<p>The largest organized religion of East Asia is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shinto</span>, an indigenous faith of Japan. It was only in the modern period, however, that Shinto belief and ceremony were <strong>codified</strong> (thus converting the faith to an organized religion).<span class="super">8</span></p>

<p>Though animism emerged in China (like everywhere else), the beliefs of this region were never gathered into an <strong>organized religion</strong>. Moreover, when discussing religion in China, it is necessary to include discussion of <strong>philosophy</strong>. Two bodies of philosophical thought, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Daoism</span> and (especially) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Confucianism</span>, have exerted enormous influence on Chinese politics, education, art, and customs. These two philosophies, which are largely concerned with ethical matters, are often described as having served an <strong>equivalent role</strong> to organized religion in China.</p>

<p><strong>Confucianism</strong> is primarily concerned with the smooth functioning of society. It identifies various types of <strong>relationships</strong> (e.g. husband-wife, sovereign-subject) and describes <strong>ritual and etiquette</strong> that should be observed in each. While Confucianism depicts society as strictly <strong>hierarchical</strong>, it also stresses that one should be equally respectful toward one's "inferiors" as one's "superiors".<span class="super">10</span></p>

<p>Thus, Confucianism asserts that virtue is rooted in adherence to a <strong>rigid system</strong> of manmade rules. <strong>Daoism</strong>, on the other hand, argues that virtue is achieved when people let go of artificial rules, instead embracing the <strong>underlying harmony</strong> of the universe. According to Daoism, humans should act according to what feels <strong>natural and effortless</strong>, while refraining from activity that feels artificial or strained.<span class="super">11</span></p>

<p>While Confucianism and Daoism can be described <strong>separately</strong>, they were not practised separately. The prevailing traditional "religion" of China has been a complex <strong>blend</strong> of Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, and ancient beliefs in spirits. The composition of this blend has <strong>varied</strong> by region and through time.<span class="super">12</span></p>
