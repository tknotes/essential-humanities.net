<h3>General Features</h3>

<p>The Second World War was fought between the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Axis Powers</span> (primarily Germany, Italy, and Japan) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allied Powers</span> (primarily Britain, France, Russia, China, and the United States). The European armies included millions of <strong>colonial soldiers</strong>, especially from Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. Technologically, World War II was fought largely with <strong>improved versions</strong> of the same weapons as the First World War; the foremost improvements were made in <strong>airplanes</strong> and <strong>tanks</strong>. The most significant new weapons were <strong>long-range missiles</strong> and <strong>nuclear bombs</strong>, although these were only developed toward the end of the war.<span class="super">A447,K360-61,1,3</span></p>

<p>The interwar period witnessed the rise of <span style="font-weight: bold;">fascism</span> in various European states (including Italy and Germany), as well as Japan. Shortly into the war, these three nations signed a pact of <strong>alliance</strong>. Japan had spent the interwar period pursuing <strong>aggressive imperialism</strong> in China, including the seizure of Manchuria (a large region of northeast China); China and Japan were thus already at war when World War II began, such that China found itself among the Allies.<span class="super">3</span></p>

<p>In the prewar period of Nazi government (1933-39), German <strong>Jews</strong> suffered vicious discrimination, including boycotts on Jewish business, banishment from the civil service, destruction of Jewish buildings (homes, businesses, synagogues), relocation to concentration camps and ghettos (walled, gated neighbourhoods), and physical attacks. By the time World War II began, <strong>thousands</strong> of Jews had already been killed. During the war itself, the Nazi government committed the <span style="font-weight: bold;">holocaust</span>: the mass imprisonment, enslavement, torture, and murder of Jews and other persecuted groups. <strong>Six million Jews</strong> died in the holocaust, as well as <strong>further millions</strong> from such groups as gypsies, homosexuals, the physically and mentally disabled, and political dissidents.<span class="super">5</span></p>

<h2>Main Article</h2>

<h3>Invasion of Poland</h3><span class="date">Sep 1939</span>

<p>In the years leading up to World War II, France and Britain attempted to evade conflict by allowing Hitler to seize <strong>neighbouring lands</strong>, including Austria and Czechoslovakia. This policy of <span style="font-weight: bold;">appeasement</span> was finally abandoned when Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939; shortly thereafter, Britain and France declared war.<span class="super">1</span> Prior to the invasion, Germany had secured a <strong>non-aggression pact</strong> with Russia in order to avoid a two-front conflict. In this same agreement, Germany assented to <strong>Soviet expansion</strong> into Eastern Europe.<span class="super">3</span></p>

<p>The conquest of Poland was accomplished in about a month via <span style="font-weight: bold;">blitzkrieg</span> ("lightning war"), a new approach to warfare in which territory was rapidly overrun with tanks and aerial bombing. Meanwhile, Russia <strong>expanded westward</strong>.</p>

</div>

<h3>Phony War</h3><span class="date">Oct 1939-Mar 1940</span>

<p>The invasion of Poland was followed by a six-month lull in military activity known as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Phony War</span> (Oct 1939-Mar 1940). Relatively little conflict occurred during this period; aggression was limited mainly to harassment of opponents' <strong>shipping routes</strong>, in the form of both blockades and direct attacks. For Britain and France, these blockades were a final, desperate attempt to smother the war before it <strong>escalated</strong> into massive casualties.<span class="super">A456,2,3</span></p>

<h3>Early Axis Expansion</h3><span class="date">Apr 1940-May 1941</span>

<p>The Phony War ended in April 1940, with the German invasion of <strong>Denmark</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong>. Thus began the <strong>early Axis expansion</strong>, which lasted from April 1940 to May 1941. The expansion occurred in <strong>all directions</strong>: north across Denmark and Norway, west across the Low Countries and France, south across North Africa, and east across the Balkans.</p>

<div class="slider-single">
<img class="slider-image" src="../../img/history/wwii2.jpg" alt="Early Axis Expansion" data-credit="<a href='http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Second_world_war_europe_1941_map_de.png'>San Jose</a> (modified by Essential Humanities)">
</div>

<p>To the west, the early Axis expansion only stopped at the border of <strong>Iberia</strong> (Spain and Portugal), which remained neutral throughout the war (as did Switzerland). Eastward, the expansion only stopped when it met up with <strong>Russian</strong> territory. Expansion across the English Channel was thwarted by British victory in the aerial <span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle of Britain</span>.<span class="super">2</span></p>

<h3>Invasion of Russia</h3><span class="date">Jun-Dec 1941</span>

<p>In 1941, World War II experienced two critical developments: the <span style="font-weight: bold;">German invasion of Russia</span> and the Japanese attack on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pearl Harbor</span>. The invasion of Russia was launched in June and lasted until December, when it was halted by the fierce Russian <strong>winter</strong>. The attack on Pearl Harbor, which lasted only <strong>hours</strong>, took place on December 7.</p>

<p>In June 1941, Germany terminated the non-aggression pact by invading Russian territory, thus creating the <strong>Eastern Front</strong> (the largest theatre of the war).<span class="super">2</span> The German advance was <strong>rapid</strong>: city after city in Eastern Europe fell to Nazi forces, with Russian defences suffering heavy casualties as a central force closed in on <strong>Moscow</strong>. Against the advice of his generals, however, Hitler temporarily <strong>diverted</strong> the Moscow force to support other attacks.<span class="super">3</span></p>

<p>The advance on Moscow eventually resumed, but too late. After only weeks of fighting, German forces were repelled and forced to <strong>maintain position</strong> through the freezing winter, suffering heavy casualties. The cold weather often disabled <strong>equipment</strong> and took an enormous toll on <strong>morale</strong>, as the Germans were short on supplies and winter clothing.<span class="super">3</span></p>

<h3>Pearl Harbor</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, Japan was preparing to amass a <strong>Pacific empire</strong>, the chief obstacle to which was the United States' Pacific Fleet. The Japanese plan was to launch a surprise attack on this fleet (at Pearl Harbor), then embark on a campaign of <strong>rapid conquest</strong>. The plan depended on the United States being unwilling to incur <strong>heavy losses</strong> over control of the region.<span class="super">3</span></p>

<p>During the interwar period, the United States had adopted a policy of <span style="font-weight: bold;">isolationism</span>, a position that is both political (non-participation in alliances/wars) and economic (protectionism). Axis aggression (including German attacks on American shipping), however, compelled the US to begin providing <strong>economic aid</strong> to Britain. Then, with the Japanese attack on <strong>Pearl Harbor</strong> (and other nearby bases) on December 7, 1941, America entered the war.<span class="super">3</span></p>

<p>The ensuing <strong>Pacific War</strong> was fought principally between the US and Japan. The Japanese initially succeeded in <strong>dominating</strong> the region, forcing the Allies to operate from Australia. Up until the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese expansion in the Pacific had been relatively minor; throughout 1942, the Japanese empire expanded rapidly across most of <strong>Southeast Asia and Oceania</strong>. The turning point in this theatre was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle of Midway</span>, June 1942.<span class="super">2,3</span></p>

<p>The Pacific War thus spanned 1942-45. Combat in the Atlantic (known as the <strong>Battle of the Atlantic</strong>), on the other hand, lasted the whole of World War II (1939-45). The <strong>turning point</strong> in this ocean came later, with the Allies finally gaining the upper hand in 1943.<span class="super">A459</span></p>

<h3>Axis Retraction</h3><span class="date">1943-44</span>

<p>The year 1942 witnessed the peak of <strong>Axis expansion and power</strong>. Allied shipping suffered heavily from U-boat attacks all over the <strong>Atlantic</strong> (as far afield as the Gulf of Mexico), while the tide of the <strong>Pacific War</strong> turned very slowly (even after the Battle of Midway) as Japan clung tenaciously to its island territories. In Europe, German expansion in <strong>Russia</strong> resumed, with remarkable success. Hitler continued to defer the attack on Moscow, instead sending two large forces southward: one to attack <strong>Stalingrad</strong>, the other to seize oil fields in the <strong>Caucasus</strong>.<span class="super">2,3</span></p>

<p>The <strong>turning point</strong> of World War II came in the winter of 1942-43, which featured two critical battles. British victory in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Battle of El Alamein</span> (November 1942) initiated the Anglo-American recovery of North Africa; this enabled the invasion of <strong>Italy</strong>, which led quickly to Italian surrender. In February 1943, the siege of Stalingrad was finally broken with Russian victory in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle of Stalingrad</span>; thenceforward, Germany was forced steadily <strong>westward</strong> by Russian forces.<span class="super">3</span></p>

<p>Axis power slowly <strong>declined</strong> over 1943-44. The Allies came to dominate the air in both Europe and the Pacific, allowing <strong>bombardment</strong> of German and Japanese cities. On June 6, 1944, the invasion of Europe began with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Normandy Landings</span> in northern France, which triggered Germany's desperate campaign of launching <strong>rockets</strong> at Britain.<span class="super">2,3</span></p>

<p>Following the liberation of <strong>France</strong>, the Allies were forced to pause for the winter and fortify their supply lines. During this pause came Hitler's final offensive: the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Battle of the Bulge</span>, in which German forces attempted to divide the Western Front and establish a foothold in Belgium. While alarmingly successful at first, the advance only succeeded in creating a temporary "bulge" in the Allied line.<span class="super">2,3</span></p>

<h3>Axis Defeat</h3><span class="date">1945</span>

<p>As winter thawed in early 1945, the Western Allies and Soviets <strong>closed in</strong> on Germany from both sides. The Nazi regime entered its death throes, and Hitler committed suicide. Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945, known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">Victory in Europe Day</span>.<span class="super">2,3</span></p>

<p>Although Japan could not hope to win the war of the Pacific, it continued to <strong>battle ferociously</strong>, relinquishing each island only with immense bloodshed. Japanese desperation culminated in the use of <span style="font-weight: bold;">kamikaze</span> pilots, who flew planes loaded with  explosives directly into US ships. Finally, with the American development of the <strong>atomic bomb</strong>, conventional operations were suspended in favour of nuclear attack.</p>

<p>In August, bombs were dropped on <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hiroshima</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nagasaki</span>. Japan surrendered on September 2, 1945, ending the Second World War.<span class="super">3</span> It had taken over <strong>fifty million lives</strong>, and remains the bloodiest conflict in history.</p>
