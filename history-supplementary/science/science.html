<h3>Definition</h3>

<p><strong>Science</strong> can be defined as "the study of how something works". The term generally denotes the <span style="font-weight: bold;">natural sciences</span>, which are concerned with the physical world (as opposed to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">social sciences</span>, which are concerned with human interaction). "Science" is a young term; until the nineteenth century, the field was referred to as <strong>natural philosophy</strong>.</p>

<p>Scientific knowledge is accumulated via the <span style="font-weight: bold;">scientific method</span>, which consists of three parts: <strong>observation</strong> (one sees something working), <strong>hypothesis</strong> (one formulates a logical theory about how it works), and <strong>testing</strong> (one searches for objective evidence of the theory). Evidence is <strong>objective</strong> if it can be physically observed or measured; any other sort of evidence (e.g. scripture, traditional belief) is unacceptable. Although the scientific method seems obvious today, pre-modern science was burdened with an abundance of false theories, due to lack of <strong>rigorous demand</strong> for objective evidence.</p>

<p>The mature scientific method only emerged during the <strong>Enlightenment</strong>  (ca. 1650-1800; see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>), which overlaps with the final decades of the Scientific Revolution (ca. 1500-1700). Though earlier Western science (dating back to ancient Greece) featured observation and hypothesis, rigorous <strong>testing</strong> was not conducted, allowing many evidence-less theories to persist.<span class="super">A309-12,4</span></p>

<p><strong>Technology</strong> may be defined as "the practical application of science".</p>

<h3>Branches</h3>

<p>The natural sciences are often divided into <strong>two branches</strong>: physical sciences and life sciences.</p>

<p>The <strong>physical sciences</strong> are often divided into four branches: physics, chemistry, astronomy, and earth sciences. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Physics</span> is the study of matter and energy; thus, all science is ultimately physics. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chemistry</span> is the study of pure substances (elements and compounds) and how they react.</p>

<p>The other two branches of physical science are defined by the <strong>region</strong> they investigate. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">earth sciences</span> study everything that comprises our planet, while <span style="font-weight: bold;">astronomy</span> is the study of everything outside Earth's atmosphere; thus, astronomy and earth sciences are simply the application of <strong>physics and chemistry</strong> to their respective regions. Earth sciences may be divided into three types: <span style="font-weight: bold;">geology</span> (solid earth), <span style="font-weight: bold;">hydrology</span> (water), and <span style="font-weight: bold;">atmospheric sciences</span> (the atmosphere).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Biology</span> (aka the "life sciences") is the study of life. More specifically, biology is the application of <strong>physics and chemistry</strong> to life forms.</p>

<p>Biology can be divided into <strong>anatomy</strong> (the study of the structure of living things) and <strong>physiology</strong> (the study of the functioning of living things). Alternatively, the field can be organized by taxonomic kingdom: <span style="font-weight: bold;">zoology</span> (the study of animals), <span style="font-weight: bold;">botany</span> (the study of plants), <span style="font-weight: bold;">mycology</span> (the study of fungi), and so on. The most immediately practical life science is <span style="font-weight: bold;">medicine</span> (the study of health and healing).</p>

<h3>Mathematics</h3>

<p>For the amateur scholar, <strong>mathematics</strong> may be defined as "the study of numbers". Numbers are not part of the physical world; they are simply a way of <strong>describing</strong> it. Mathematics is therefore the <strong>abstract science</strong>, rather than a natural science. Mathematics serves as the <strong>language</strong> of all other sciences.</p>

<p>Mathematics can be reduced to <strong>three basic fields</strong>: algebra, geometry, and calculus. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Algebra</span> is the study of generalized operations. (An operation is the production of a new number from input numbers, e.g. 2+2=4; algebra generalizes operations by using symbols to represent numbers, e.g. a+a=2a.)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Geometry</span> is the study of shapes and spaces. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Calculus</span> is the study of continuous change (e.g. the changing position of a moving object, or the changing speed of an accelerating object). While algebra and geometry date to <strong>antiquity</strong>, calculus was only invented during the <strong>Scientific Revolution</strong> (by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz, independently).</p>

<h3>The Math-Physics Foundation</h3>

<p>From antiquity to the Scientific Revolution (ca. 1500-1700), most scientific progress took place in <strong>mathematics</strong> and <strong>physics</strong>.<span class="super">A308</span> These two fields naturally flourished together, as ancient and medieval thinkers observed <strong>physical phenomena</strong> (e.g. planetary motion) and attempted to describe them with <strong>numbers</strong>. This symbiosis culminated in the <strong>Scientific Revolution</strong>, during which understanding of physics and mathematics surged to unprecedented heights, cresting with Newton's formulation of <strong>classical mechanics</strong> and invention of <strong>calculus</strong>.</p>

<p>The mature <strong>scientific method</strong> finally emerged amidst the mathematics and physics of the Scientific Revolution, causing progress to become <strong>permanently rapid</strong> in all scientific fields. Thus did mathematics and physics serve as the <strong>launchpad</strong> of modern science. This fact is reflected in the structure of this article, which focuses mainly on physics up until the Scientific Revolution, then branches out to include chemistry and biology.</p>

<h2>Main Article</h2>

<h3>Theoretical Science</h3>

<p><strong>Astronomy</strong> and <strong>mathematics</strong> were the first sciences of all ancient civilizations. The great astronomer-mathematicians of <strong>antiquity</strong> included the Mesopotamians, Chinese, Indians, Greeks, and Maya.<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p>Two kinds of science emerged in the pre-modern world. The most common was <strong>observational science</strong>, in which natural phenomena are carefully observed and described, but not logically explained. (In other words, only one part of the scientific method is practised: <strong>observation</strong>.) While observational science enabled profound scientific discoveries and impressive technological advances, explanations for natural events (if developed at all) were limited to arbitrary supernatural forces.<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p><strong>Theoretical science</strong>, on the other hand, takes the additional step of providing logical explanations for natural phenomena. (Thus, <strong>hypothesis</strong> is practised in addition to <strong>observation</strong>.) Natural events are described in terms of <strong>universal laws</strong>; if gods or magic are included in the description, they are nonetheless subject to these laws. Only once in history did theoretical science firmly develop: in <strong>ancient Greece</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/history-supplementary/greek-awakening">Greek Awakening</a>).<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p>The equivalent is true of <strong>mathematics</strong>: while various civilizations garnered impressive mathematical knowledge, <strong>theoretical mathematics</strong> was only devised by the ancient Greeks. In theoretical mathematics, a set of <strong>axioms</strong> (fundamental assumptions) is established, from which general <strong>theories</strong> are logically derived. In non-theoretical mathematics, mathematical laws are only guessed at via repeated observations; they cannot be <strong>proven</strong>.<span class="super">26</span></p>

<p>Consider the <strong>Pythagorean theorem</strong>, which states that for a right angle triangle with sides a, b, and c (c being the diagonal), a<span class="super">2</span>+b<span class="super">2</span>=c<span class="super">2</span>. This relationship might be noticed via <strong>repeated observation</strong>, by drawing several triangles of different sizes, then measuring and comparing the sides of each. Yet it would remain unknown whether the relationship <strong>always</strong> holds true; this knowledge can only be obtained through the reasoned proofs of theoretical mathematics.</p>

<p>It should be emphasized that the ingenuity and technological advances of <strong>non-Western science</strong>, and their importance for Western progress, were immense; this was indeed true from the very start, given that the ancient Greeks inherited a large body of mathematical and astronomical knowledge from <strong>Mesopotamia</strong>. The most extraordinary non-Western technological achievements are those of <strong>China</strong>, which early in its history rose to global technological supremacy, remaining there until the Early Modern age.<span class="super">4</span> During the <strong>medieval period</strong>, Europe tapped an invaluable flow of technology and mathematical/scientific knowledge from China, India, and the Islamic world.</p>

<h3>Ancient Science</h3><div class="date">ca. 800 BC-500 AD</div>

<p>The birth of Western science (i.e. theoretical science) can be traced to the <strong>Archaic</strong> period (ca. 800-500 BC) of ancient Greece, when thinkers began to ponder a simple question: "is there a fundamental substance from which all matter is composed?". The first person to explore this question was apparently <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thales</span>, who argued that this substance is water.<span class="super">4</span> Thales, who we would describe today as a physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and engineer, thus founded the field of physics, and is known as the <strong>father of Western science</strong>.</p>

<p>Thales was followed by other philosophers who argued in favour of other elements. Eventually, the notion of a single fundamental substance was joined by various multiple-element systems, including the <span style="font-weight: bold;">four classical elements</span> (air, water, earth, fire), which remained an influential theory until the Scientific Revolution. The degree to which something is hot/cold and wet/dry was explained by the <strong>proportions</strong> of these elements.<span class="super">4</span></p>

<div class="slider-single">
<img class="slider-image" src="../../img/history/classel.jpg" alt="The Four Classical Elements" data-credit="<a href='http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Four_elements_representation.svg'>Heron</a>">
</div>

<p>Some Greek theorists even argued that the material world is made up of tiny particles called <strong>atoms</strong>, and that the various materials and phenomena of the material world are explained by simple differences among these particles (e.g. size, motion, configuration). Atomism would remain a minority scientific position, however, until it was conclusively proven in the modern age.

<p><strong>Greek science</strong> continued to develop throughout the Classical period, then peaked during the Hellenistic age and early Roman period. (During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, the leading centre of Greek science was <strong>Alexandria</strong>.) Major fields of inquiry included geometry, algebra, astronomy, mechanics, anatomy, and medicine; thus was the <strong>foundation</strong> of Western science established. (The Romans showed little interest in theoretical science, though they did eagerly pursue technological advances.)<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p>The leading scientific figure of Classical Greece was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Aristotle</span>, who performed detailed studies of animals and developed a refined system of classifying life, such that he is often considered the <strong>father of biology</strong>.<span class="super">4</span> He also developed a <strong>model of the universe</strong> based on the four classical elements. According to this model, the elements naturally strive to occupy different <strong>levels</strong>: earth at the centre, water above earth, air above water, and fire above air.<span class="super">15</span></p>

<p>The heavenly bodies are made of a fifth, divine substance called <span style="font-weight: bold;">ether</span>.<span class="super">15</span> Aristotle reasoned that a divine substance could only have &#8220;perfect motion&#8221;, which he defined as a circle; therefore, the heavenly bodies must have <strong>circular orbits</strong> around the Earth.<span class="super">4</span> His model is thus <span style="font-weight: bold;">geocentric</span> (&#8220;Earth-centred&#8221;).</p>

<p>Though Aristotle&#8217;s model gained <strong>widespread acceptance</strong>, it clashed with astronomical observation. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ptolemy</span>, a Roman-age Greek scientist, addressed this problem by introducing several <strong>embellishments</strong>; for instance, he argued that each planet moves in a small circle (an epicycle) while moving along its orbit (see topmost <a href="http://www.keplersdiscovery.com/Hypotheses.html">animation</a>). The <strong>Ptolemaic model</strong>, which had much-improved predictive power, would not be overturned until the Scientific Revolution.</p>

<h3>Medieval Science</h3><div class="date">ca. 500-1500</div>

<p>In the <strong>Dark Ages</strong> (ca. 500-1000), scientific progress essentially ceased in Europe, as the continent became overwhelmingly preoccupied with <strong>religious matters</strong>. Some ancient knowledge was preserved in the monasteries of Western Europe and more in the libraries of the Byzantine Empire, but the true successor to classical science was the <strong>Islamic world</strong>, which absorbed much Greek learning (particularly from Alexandria) and proceeded to expand upon it in every field. Islamic advances in mathematics and chemistry, for instance, are reflected in the familiar terms &#8220;algebra&#8221; and &#8220;alkali&#8221;, both from <strong>Arabic</strong>.<span class="super">2,4</span></p>

<p>With the recovery of Western Europe in the later Middle Ages (ca. 1000-1500), <strong>Islamic</strong> advances (as well as much original Greek work that had only survived among the Arabs) were absorbed.<span class="super">4</span> Europe also enjoyed the transmission of <strong>East and South Asian</strong> advances via the Muslim world. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hindu-Arabic numeral system</span> originated in India, where the invention of zero had made the system possible; the name &#8220;Hindu-Arabic&#8221; reflects the development of the system in India and the subsequent modification of its ten symbols as it passed through the Arab world. From China, two critical inventions arrived: <span style="font-weight: bold;">gunpowder</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">paper</span>, both of which dramatically accelerated the course of Western history.<span class="super">1</span></p>

<p>In Western Europe itself, theoretical science was stifled during the later Middle Ages by obsession with making scientific theory compatible with <strong>theology</strong>. On the other hand, various important <strong>practical advances</strong> were made, including the mechanical clock, wind and water mills, and the printing press. Indeed, without the <strong>printing press</strong> (to rapidly distribute scientific advances to thinkers across Europe), modern science might never have emerged. By the end of the Middle Ages, the stage was set for the <strong>Scientific Revolution</strong>.<span class="super">2,3,4</span></p>

<h3>Scientific Revolution</h3><div class="date">ca. 1500-1700</div>

<p>The overarching triumph of the Scientific Revolution was the development of the mature <span style="font-weight: bold;">scientific method</span>. This period also gave rise to the first scientific societies, most notably the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Royal Society</span> of London and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Académie des Sciences</span> of Paris.<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p>The leading figures of the Scientific Revolution (ca. 1500-1700) are four <strong>astronomers</strong>. Copernicus lived at the <strong>beginning</strong> of this period, while Galileo and Kepler are found in the <strong>middle</strong>. The <strong>late</strong> Scientific Revolution is crowned with the career of Isaac Newton.</p>

<p>The birth of the Scientific Revolution is often traced to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Copernicus</span>, who finally refuted the Ptolemaic universe with the first convincing model of <span style="font-weight: bold;">heliocentrism</span>, thereby becoming the &#8220;father of modern astronomy&#8221;.<span class="super">3</span> Heliocentrism asserts that the Earth <strong>orbits the sun</strong> (causing the seasons) and <strong>rotates</strong> (causing day and night). This model was only gradually accepted, meeting with both scientific and (especially) theological <strong>resistance</strong>.</p>

<p>Theologically, the heliocentric model was considered unacceptable as it diminished Earth&#8217;s <strong>apparent importance</strong> in the universe. If Copernicus was right, not only was the Earth not at the <strong>centre</strong> of everything, it was also a tiny ball of matter in the midst of <strong>staggeringly vast</strong> space. If the Earth is in constant motion around the sun, then at night the stars should appear to be <strong>constantly moving</strong>; the only alternative explanation is that the stars are so incredibly <strong>far away</strong> that they don&#8217;t appear to move.<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p>The chief <strong>scientific objection</strong> to the heliocentric model was that if the Earth is spinning, everything on the planet&#8217;s surface should be hurled into space.<span class="super">4</span> The answer to this argument is, of course, <span style="font-weight: bold;">gravity</span>: the gravitational pull of the Earth far exceeds the outward force exerted by the planet&#8217;s rotation. But the force of gravity would not be identified until <strong>Newton</strong>.</p>

<p>The first person to study the heavens via telescope was <span style="font-weight: bold;">Galileo Galilei</span>.<span class="super">12</span> Galileo&#8217;s observations helped to further discredit the Ptolemaic model by demonstrating that other heavenly bodies are not so unlike the Earth: they have their own <strong>geography</strong> (e.g. the moon has rugged craters; it is not a smooth sphere of divine substance), and other planets have <strong>moons</strong> of their own (e.g. Galileo discovered the moons of Jupiter; this conflicted with the Ptolemaic model, in which all heavenly bodies orbit the Earth). Galileo also observed the phases of <strong>Venus</strong>, proving that this planet orbits the sun.<span class="super">K266-67,4</span></p>

<p>Galileo was also the leading scientist in the field of <span style="font-weight: bold;">mechanics</span> (the study of moving bodies) prior to Newton.  Most famously, he demonstrated that weight does not affect how fast an object <strong>falls</strong>. He also proved that the path of a projectile is a <strong>parabola</strong>, thus overturning the prevailing belief that a projectile moves in a straight line until it runs out of momentum, then falls straight down.<span class="super">16</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Johannes Kepler</span> advanced the heliocentric model by finally developing an accurate description of <strong>planetary orbits</strong>, summarized in three laws.<span class="super">4</span> One: the path of each planet&#8217;s orbit around the sun is an <strong>ellipse</strong> (not a circle). Two: the <strong>speed</strong> of a planet&#8217;s orbit increases as it gets closer to the sun. Kepler&#8217;s third law is the proportional relationship between the <strong>size and period</strong> of a planet&#8217;s orbit.</p>

<p>Yet the very <strong>force</strong> that causes planets to orbit the sun (gravity) remained a mystery. The most influential theory prior to Newton was that space is filled with some kind of <strong>invisible matter</strong> (which, borrowing Aristotle&#8217;s term, was referred to as &#8220;ether&#8221;) and that whirlpools in this matter sweep the planets along. This explanation was dispelled by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Isaac Newton</span>, whose three <strong>laws of motion</strong> and universal <strong>law of gravitation</strong> explained not only the motion of the planets, but of all physical objects.<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p>Newton&#8217;s laws provide a complete description of the mechanics of everyday experience, also known as <span style="font-weight: bold;">classical mechanics</span>. They only cease to hold true at extreme <strong>physical scales</strong>, whether very large (when relativity applies) or very small (when quantum theory applies).</p>

<p>Newton described these laws in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</span> (often referred to simply as the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Principia</span>), arguably the most important scientific document ever written. It contains the laws described above, as well as descriptions of those laws using <strong>calculus</strong>, which Newton was compelled to invent.</p>

<p>In addition to revolutionizing physics and mathematics, Newton was a leading figure in developing and propagating the mature <strong>scientific method</strong>. (Francis Bacon, it may be noted, was another key English proponent of meticulous observation and experiment.) In short, Isaac Newton is the leading figure of the Scientific Revolution, and is often considered the <strong>foremost scientist</strong> of all time.<span class="super">4,13</span></p>

<h3>Wave Theory of Light</h3>

<p>Newton did eventually lose support for one major argument, however, when his assertion that light is composed of <strong>particles</strong> was superseded by the <strong>wave theory</strong> of light.<span class="super">1</span></p>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">wave</span> is simply a &#8220;moving disturbance&#8221; (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aguCWnbRETU&amp;feature=related">video</a>). Imagine a sealed transparent tube filled with <strong>marbles</strong> (with a small amount of wiggle room); if one end of the tube is struck, the marbles at that end of the tube will strike the marbles next to them, which strike the marbles next to them, and so on. The <strong>disturbance</strong> will travel the full length of the tube, though the particles (represented by the marbles) will return to their original positions after the wave has passed. This is how <strong>sound waves</strong> travel through the air; the air particles are like marbles (see topmost <a href="http://paws.kettering.edu/%7Edrussell/Demos/waves/wavemotion.html">animation</a>).</p>

<p>All <strong>waves</strong> obey a number of physical laws (e.g. reflection, refraction); as it became clear that light obeys these laws, the wave theory of light prevailed. Yet a wave cannot exist without a <strong>medium</strong> to travel through, and scientists needed an explanation for how light could travel through space. Thus, even though the theory of swirling <strong>ether</strong> (to explain the motion of the planets) had been abandoned, the notion of ether itself (an invisible form of matter filling all space) was retained.</p>

<p>The notion of light as a disturbance travelling through <strong>ether</strong> persisted all the way to the twentieth century. Today, light waves are understood to be disturbances in an <strong>electromagnetic field</strong>; the waves themselves generate this electromagnetic field, such that are <strong>self-propagating</strong>. (As an analogy, consider a wave travelling along the surface of the ocean. This wave can only travel as far as the ocean lasts; when it reaches the shore, it will crash. If it were self-propagating, however, it would constantly generate a stretch of water in front of itself, allowing it to travel an infinite distance.)</p>

<h3><span id="Classical_Physics">Classical Physics</span></h3><div class="date">ca. 1700-1900</div>

<p>During the <strong>classical age</strong> of science (ca. 1700-1900), scientific fields matured into their recognizably modern forms. The profession of <strong>scientist</strong> finally emerged, with the development of educational programs devoted to science and sharp increases in government funding; previously, scientific progress had depended mainly on the work of independently wealthy individuals. The <strong>Industrial Revolution</strong> played a central role in driving scientific progress, as scientists took up the challenges of developing <strong>new technologies</strong> (and new technologies, in turn, allowed the natural world to be explored more deeply and accurately than ever before).<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p>Classical physics can be summed up in <strong>three primary advances</strong>: modern atomic theory, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism.</p>

<p>The easiest to explain is <span style="font-weight: bold;">modern atomic theory</span>, founded by <span style="font-weight: bold;">John Dalton</span>. Dalton proved that all matter is made up of <strong>elements</strong> (which cannot be separated into simpler substances), and that atoms of these elements differ by <strong>mass</strong> alone.<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Thermodynamics</span> is the study of the conversion of heat into work. This field, which emerged as scientists attempted to improve the efficiency of <strong>steam engines</strong>, gave rise to the three <span style="font-weight: bold;">laws of thermodynamics</span>. The first two were worked out during the <strong>classical age</strong>, while the third was added in the <strong>twentieth century</strong>.<span class="super">24</span></p>

<table class="standard">
<caption>Laws of Thermodynamics</caption>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="odd bo">first law</td>
<td>the total amount of energy in an isolated system is constant<br />(energy cannot be created or destroyed)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="odd bo">second law</td>
<td>the entropy of an isolated system increases over time,<br />until its temperature is the same throughout</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="odd bo">third law</td>
<td>if heat is extracted from a system, its entropy decreases, approaching zero<br />entropy as the temperature of the system approaches absolute zero</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>An <strong>isolated system</strong> is a region of the universe which is sealed off, such that no matter or energy can enter or escape. It is simply a helpful imaginary concept, though it does describe the <strong>universe</strong> as a whole.</p>

<p>One property of a system is <span style="font-weight: bold;">entropy</span>, which denotes the amount of &#8220;chaos&#8221; in the system. There are two ways of looking at physical <strong>chaos</strong>. One is <strong>total energy</strong>: the more energy a system has (i.e. the hotter it is), the more violently particles bounce around, and thus the higher the system&#8217;s entropy. The other is the degree to which energy is <strong>evenly spread</strong> throughout a system. When energy is neatly <strong>organized</strong> into distinct sections (e.g. a cold ice cube in a warm glass of water), entropy is low. As this organization <strong>breaks down</strong> (e.g. as the ice cube melts) and energy becomes more evenly spread, entropy rises.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Electromagnetism</span> is the relationship between electricity, magnetism, and light. It was worked out by various scientists during the classical age of science, especially <span style="font-weight: bold;">James Clerk Maxwell</span>, who produced a set of <strong>four equations</strong> (known as &#8220;Maxwell&#8217;s equations&#8221;) that describe this relationship.<span class="super">1</span> Maxwell is thus often hailed as the &#8220;Newton&#8221; of the classical age of science.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental properties of nature is that an object can have an <span style="font-weight: bold;">electric charge</span>. Objects with opposite charges <strong>attract</strong> one another, while objects with like charges <strong>repel</strong> one another. This force of attraction/repulsion is referred to as <span style="font-weight: bold;">electric force</span>; the region in which this force can be felt is called an <span style="font-weight: bold;">electric field</span>.</p>

<p>When a charged object moves, it generates a <span style="font-weight: bold;">magnetic field</span> (in addition to its electric field). A magnetic field, which is neither positive or negative, has a <strong>north pole</strong> and a <strong>south pole</strong>; when two magnetic fields come into contact, opposite poles attract while like poles repel. This force of attraction/repulsion is <span style="font-weight: bold;">magnetic force</span>.</p>

<p>The nature of <strong>electromagnetism</strong> may be summed up in three statements. One: a <strong>stationary</strong> charged object generates an electric field. Two: a <strong>moving</strong> charged object generates a magnetic field, which combines with the electric field to form an <strong>electromagnetic field</strong>. Three: light waves are disturbances in an electromagnetic field; these disturbances are caused when a moving charged object <strong>changes speed</strong> (i.e. accelerates or decelerates).</p>

<p>Due to heat energy, all particles constantly <strong>vibrate</strong>. A charged vibrating particle constantly produces <strong>disturbances</strong> in its electromagnetic field; thus, all matter constantly emits <strong>light</strong>, though most is not visible to the human eye. The hotter particles are, the faster they vibrate, and the higher <strong>frequency</strong> light they produce.</p>

<p>Frequency refers to the <strong>spaces</strong> between waves. When waves are emitted <strong>rapidly</strong>, the spaces between them are small, and thus their frequency is high (e.g. X-rays); likewise, when waves are emitted <strong>slowly</strong>, their frequency is low (e.g. radio waves). <strong>Visible light</strong> lies in a narrow range of frequencies toward the middle of the spectrum.</p>

<h3>Classical Chemistry and Biology</h3><div class="date">ca. 1700-1900</div>

<p>The leading figure of classical chemistry is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Antoine Lavoisier</span>, the "father of modern chemistry", who led the charge in making chemistry a field of <strong>precise measurement</strong>. This allowed him to discover the <span style="font-weight: bold;">law of conservation of mass</span>, which states that the mass of the products of a chemical reaction is equal to the mass of the reactants. Perhaps his other most famous discovery is that <strong>combustion</strong> is a reaction between a substance and oxygen.<span class="super">4</span></p>

<p>Classical biology, meanwhile, featured two exceptional figures.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Louis Pasteur</span>, the "father of microbiology", proved that microscopic life only arises from <strong>reproduction</strong>; it does not arise from non-living matter, as claimed by the prevailing theory of "spontaneous generation". He demonstrated that both fermentation and food spoilage is caused by microscopic organisms, and showed that heat treatment (aka <span style="font-weight: bold;">pasteurization</span>) could prevent the latter. He also played a leading role in the development of <span style="font-weight: bold;">germ theory</span> (which asserts that diseases are caused by microscopic life) and <span style="font-weight: bold;">vaccinations</span>.<span class="super">1</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Charles Darwin</span> founded <span style="font-weight: bold;">evolution theory</span>. While evolution was an old concept (dating back, like so many things, to ancient Greece), Darwin gave it a <strong>scientific basis</strong> via meticulous observational studies and identification of a mechanism by which evolution could occur. This mechanism was <span style="font-weight: bold;">natural selection</span>, which asserts that a species evolves more favourable characteristics over time as individuals with better-adapted characteristics survive to reproduce.<span class="super">4</span></p>

<h3>Modern Science</h3><div class="date">ca. 1900-present</div>

<p>As the classical age of science drew to a close, it was beginning to look as though scientists had <strong>completely unravelled</strong> the workings of the physical world. This illusion was shattered ca. 1900, when the discovery of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">electron</span> advanced science to the subatomic level; soon after came the discovery of <span style="font-weight: bold;">radioactivity</span> (unstable atoms that crumble into smaller atoms, giving off energy in the process).<span class="super">4</span> Further exploration into the subatomic world has yielded the <span style="font-weight: bold;">standard model</span>, which asserts that all matter is comprised of quarks, leptons, and bosons.</p>

<p>During the early twentieth century, two pillars of modern physics were erected: quantum theory and relativity. While the former was developed by numerous scientists, the latter was primarily the work of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Albert Einstein</span>, the indisputable "Newton" of modern science.<span class="super">1</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quantum theory</span> is the current explanation of how the universe works at extremely small scales. The theory asserts that energy exists in discrete packets, each of which is called a <span style="font-weight: bold;">quantum</span> (plural quanta). This was discovered when experiments showed that light (a form of energy) can only be absorbed/emitted (by an object) in <strong>discrete amounts</strong>; it cannot be absorbed/emitted continuously.</p>

<p>In this respect, light behaves as though it were composed of <strong>particles</strong>. Indeed, light is now described as having <span style="font-weight: bold;">wave-particle duality</span>, since it behaves like waves in some ways and like particles in others. It has since been discovered that all <strong>particles</strong>, and indeed all <strong>objects</strong>, exhibit wave-particle duality (although wave-like properties are negligible in all but the tiniest objects).<span class="super">9</span></p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">theory of relativity</span> encompasses a number of unintuitive ideas, including that physical perception is relative to the <strong>speed of the observer</strong> (except for the speed of light in a vacuum, which remains constant for all observers), that <strong>time and space</strong> are connected (together forming the unified phenomenon of spacetime), and that energy and mass are <strong>convertible</strong> (expressed in the equation E=mc<span class="super">2</span>).</p>

<p>Modern chemistry and biology have been dominated by advances at <strong>very small scales</strong>. Understanding of the subatomic level has allowed chemical reactions to be explained in terms of the formation and breakage of <strong>electromagnetic bonds</strong> between particles.<span class="super">1</span> Biology has also been extended to extremely small scales, enabling the rise of <strong>molecular biology</strong> (including the discovery of DNA) and exploration of the world's tiniest <strong>life forms</strong> (including viruses).</p>
