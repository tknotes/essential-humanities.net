<h3>General Features</h3>

<p>The leading regions of Baroque music were <strong>Italy</strong> and <strong>Germany</strong>; the other major contributor was <strong>France</strong>. Indeed, these three regions (plus <strong>Austria</strong>, beginning in the Classical period) remained the heart of Western composition throughout the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods.</p>

<p>Baroque music is quite distinct from that of the <strong>Renaissance</strong>; two primary distinguishing features are <strong>major-minor tonality</strong> and <strong>basso continuo</strong>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Major-minor tonality</span> denotes that a composition is both <strong>tonal</strong> (centred around a fundamental note) and based on <strong>major and minor scales</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-supplementary/tonality">Tonality</a>). Medieval and Renaissance music, though indeed tonal, was based on the eight <strong>church modes</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/western-art/music/medieval-renaissance">Medieval and Renaissance Music</a>). Major-minor tonality dominated Western music throughout the <strong>Baroque, Classical, and Romantic</strong> periods (and continues to flourish in modern popular music, film music, and musical theatre).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Basso continuo</span>, on the other hand, was limited mainly to the Baroque period of Western music. This term denotes a style of <strong>accompaniment</strong> comprised of two instruments: one instrument (typically a cello) provides a <strong>bassline</strong>, while the other (typically a harpsichord) provides improvised <strong>chords</strong>.<span class="super">2</span></p>

<h3>Instrumental Music</h3>

<p>The Baroque era marks the rise of instrumental music to an <strong>equal footing</strong> with vocal music in the Western world. Baroque composers especially favoured the <strong>violin</strong>, <strong>harpsichord</strong>, and <strong>organ</strong>. Indeed, Baroque-era Germany was the "golden age" of organ composition.<span class="super">I173,I234,I255</span></p>

<p>Instrumental music can be divided into <span style="font-weight: bold;">program music</span>, which the composer intends to evoke specific events or images; and <span style="font-weight: bold;">absolute music</span>, which lacks this intention.</p>

<h3>Multi-movement Works</h3>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">multi-movement work</span> consists of multiple, self-contained works, each of which is referred to as a <strong>movement</strong>. Multi-movement works are common in Western music from the Baroque age onward. Typically, the movements <strong>vary</strong> in character (notably tempo) in order to provide contrast throughout the work.</p>

<p>In a work of <strong>absolute music</strong> (such as a symphony), each movement is typically named according to its <strong>tempo</strong> (e.g. allegro, andante). In a work of <strong>program music</strong> (such as a symphonic poem), each movement is typically named according to the <strong>imagery</strong> associated with the music (e.g. <em>Scene in the Country</em>, <em>Tortoises</em>).</p>

<p>Sometimes a multi-movement work is called a <strong>suite</strong> (e.g. piano suite) or <strong>cycle</strong> (e.g. song cycle).</p>

<h3>Rise of the Orchestra</h3>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">orchestra</span> emerged in the Baroque era, serving initially as accompaniment for <strong>opera</strong>. As opera developed and expanded, so did the orchestra.<span class="super">J49</span></p>

<p>In addition to its main role (accompaniment of singers), the orchestra came to provide <strong>instrumental passages</strong> in the course of an opera. Such passages include the <strong>overture</strong> (at the beginning), <strong>interludes</strong> (between scenes), and accompaniment for <strong>dance sequences</strong>. Independent orchestral music was born when these instrumental passages (especially overtures) came to be performed as <strong>standalone works</strong>.<span class="super">I252,J50</span></p>

<p>The <strong>symphony</strong> was born when standalone orchestral music was extended into multiple movements. (The term "symphony" did not become standard until the Classical period, however; pre-Classical symphonies are often called overtures or sinfonias.) The <strong>concerto</strong> (discussed in greater detail below) emerged as a specialized form of the symphony, in which the orchestra is divided into two "voices".</p>

<p>The Baroque orchestra consisted primarily of a <strong>string section</strong> with <strong>basso continuo</strong> accompaniment. This core was generally <strong>augmented</strong> by some combination of woodwinds, trumpets, horns, and/or timpani. The familiar <strong>modern orchestra</strong> emerged as the orchestra underwent continuous expansion and refinement throughout the Classical and Romantic periods.</p>

<h3>Primary Genres</h3>

From the Baroque age onward, Western music can be divided into three groups according to scale: <strong>solo</strong>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">small ensemble</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">large ensemble</span>.

<p><strong>Solo</strong> music of the Baroque and Classical periods was composed for many instruments, but especially <strong>keyboard</strong> and <strong>violin</strong>. A common term for "solo instrumental work" is <strong>sonata</strong>. (Note that "solo music" for a non-keyboard instrument usually features keyboard accompaniment.) During the Baroque era, the primary keyboard instruments were the <strong>organ</strong>, <strong>harpsichord</strong>, and <strong>clavichord</strong>.</p>

<p>Works for <strong>small ensemble</strong> are often named for their number of parts (trio, quartet, quintet, etc). The leading type of small ensemble during the Baroque age was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">trio sonata</span>, which features two melody instruments (often violins) supported by basso continuo (which is considered a single part of the "trio").<span class="super">2</span></p>

<p><strong>Large ensemble</strong> music can be classified as <strong>orchestral</strong> or <strong>vocal</strong>.</p>

<p>The leading form of <strong>orchestral</strong> music during the Baroque age was the <span style="font-weight: bold;">concerto</span>, which features two "voices". One voice is the <strong>orchestra</strong>; the other is either a <strong>small ensemble</strong> or a <strong>single instrument</strong>. Throughout a concerto, the two voices play both together and separately, imitating and contrasting with one another.</p>

<p>A concerto that pairs the orchestra with a small ensemble is known as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">concerto grosso</span>; with a single instrument, a <span style="font-weight: bold;">solo concerto</span>. While both types flourished in the Baroque era, only the solo concerto remained popular throughout the Classical and Romantic periods. (In discussion of Classical and Romantic music, the term "concerto" is synonymous with "solo concerto".)</p>

<p>The two great <strong>vocal</strong> genres of the Baroque age were <strong>opera</strong> and <strong>sacred choral</strong> works.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opera</span>, which is essentially the fusion of theatre and music, typically features two kinds of vocal passages: <strong>speaking</strong> (which advances the story) and <strong>songs</strong> (which highlight important parts of the story). Speaking may take the form of <strong>recitative</strong> ("talk-singing") or <strong>plain speech</strong>, while singing includes <strong>arias</strong> (solo songs), <strong>small group songs</strong> (duets, trios, etc.) and <strong>choruses</strong>.</p>

<p>The two great forms of Baroque sacred choral music are the <strong>oratorio</strong> and <strong>mass</strong>.</p>

<p>An <span style="font-weight: bold;">oratorio</span> may be defined as "an opera with the acting removed". Like opera, an oratorio tells a story with a cast of characters who <strong>speak</strong> (with plain speech or recitative) and <strong>sing</strong> (arias, small group songs, choruses). The performance is simply directed to the audience, however; the characters do not <strong>interact</strong>.<span class="super">I200-01,I224</span></p>

<p>A brief oratorio is called a <strong>cantata</strong>. Oratorios and cantatas are usually <strong>sacred</strong> (as opposed to opera, which is usually <strong>secular</strong>).</p>

<p>The core of the Roman Catholic religious service is <strong>Mass</strong>, a ceremony that commemorates the Last Supper. In addition to scriptural readings and symbolic consumption of bread and wine, the ceremony includes <strong>recitations</strong> (sung or spoken) of certain prayers; a musical setting of these prayers is known as a <strong>mass</strong> (e.g. Bach's <em>Mass in B Minor</em>). The standard prayers of the mass are the Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus, and Agnus Dei.</p>

<p>During the medieval and Renaissance periods, the mass thrived as one of the <strong>principal forms</strong> of Western art music. (As the Middle Ages drew on, <strong>plainchant</strong> masses, the original type, were joined by <strong>polyphonic</strong> masses.) The mass remained important after the Renaissance, though its prominence declined.</p>

<h3>Baroque Music</h3><div class="date">ca. 1600-1750</div>

<p>The three most renowned figures in Baroque music are <strong>Vivaldi</strong>, <strong>Handel</strong>, and <strong>Bach</strong>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Antonio Vivaldi</span>, priest and violinist, was the foremost Italian composer of the age, known primarily for composing hundreds of <strong>concertos</strong> (chiefly solo concertos). His most famous body of work is <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Four Seasons</span>, a set of four violin concertos.</p>

German-British composer <span style="font-weight: bold;">George Frideric Handel</span> excelled primarily in <strong>operas</strong> and <strong>oratorios</strong>.<span class="super">12</span> The English-language oratorio <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Messiah</span> (which includes the famous <span style="font-style: italic;">Hallelujah Chorus</span>) is considered his masterpiece. Handel's best known instrumental works are a number of <strong>dance suites</strong>, namely <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Water Music</span> (a group of three dance suites) and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Fireworks Music</span> (a single dance suite).

<p>The foremost composer of the Baroque era is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Johann Sebastian Bach</span>, who excelled in all major genres of the age except opera (which he did not pursue). Bach is particularly renowned for his solo keyboard works, concertos, and sacred vocal works.<span class="super">I256</span></p>

<p>In the field of <strong>solo keyboard music</strong>, Bach is considered the greatest composer of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">fugue</span>: a contrapuntal work in which a theme is constantly passed between different lines in the texture (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-supplementary/musical-texture">Musical Texture</a>). While some of Bach's fugues are standalone, most are the second component of a <strong>two-part work</strong>. The most famous of all fugues is found in <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</span>.</p>

<p>When a fugue lies within a two-part work, the first part is typically a composition of whimsical, <strong>improvisatory</strong> character (thus contrasting sharply with the formal, <strong>structured</strong> nature of a fugue). Common terms for <strong>improvisation-style compositions</strong> include prelude, fantasia, and toccata. This style of work emerged naturally from <strong>warm-up exercises</strong>, which encompass improvised mixtures of runs, arpeggios, leaps, and ornaments.</p>

<p>Bach's foremost <strong>concertos</strong> are the six <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Brandenburg Concertos</span>, which comprise the pinnacle of the concerto grosso.</p>

<p>In terms of <strong>sacred vocal music</strong>, Bach was a prolific composer of the <strong>mass</strong>, <strong>oratorio</strong>, and <strong>cantata</strong>. His most renowned vocal works may be the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">St Matthew Passion</span> (an oratorio) and the <strong><em>Mass in B Minor</em></strong>.</p>

<h3>The Birth of Opera</h3>

<p>In the final decades of the Renaissance, various Florentine composers (known collectively as the "Florentine Camerata") strove to emulate <strong>ancient Greek theatre</strong> (which had included musical elements; see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/western-art/literature/ancient">Ancient Literature</a>). These composers wrote the first modern plays in which lines are <strong>sung</strong> rather than spoken. Indeed, they invented a new kind of singing for this purpose: <strong>recitative</strong>, in which melody imitates the rise and fall of natural speech. These works could be described as "sung plays" or "proto-opera".<span class="super">2,8</span></p>

<p>Proto-opera drew the attention of many composers across Italy. Opera emerged as these composers expanded the "sung play" beyond recitative to include <strong>songs</strong> (arias, small group songs, and choruses), as well as instrumental <strong>accompaniment</strong> (which grew from small ensembles into full-fledged orchestras). <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Orfeo</span></span>, by <span style="font-weight: bold;">Claudio Monteverdi</span>, is generally considered the first true opera.<span class="super">I189-90,2,3,7,8</span></p>

<p>During the first few decades of the Baroque period, opera was predominantly <strong>serious</strong> (as opposed to comic) in character. Thus, <strong>serious Italian opera</strong> was the very first type of opera. Throughout the Baroque age, serious Italian opera came to focus primarily on <strong>arias</strong>, which grew increasingly long and elaborate.<span class="super">I214-17,3</span></p>

<p>Radiating from Italy, serious opera was widely embraced by Western Europe. Indeed, the most enduring composer of serious Italian opera is German-English composer <strong>Handel</strong>. His greatest operatic work is often considered to be <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Giulio Cesare</span></span> ("Julius Caesar").</p>

</div>

<p>In time, other <strong>regional styles</strong> of serious opera developed (using Italian opera as a model), especially in Germany, England, and France. <strong>Serious German opera</strong> would eventually (in the Romantic period) become a primary force in the opera world. The flowering of <strong>serious English opera</strong> was swifter, but limited to the Baroque era and to essentially one composer: <strong>Henry Purcell</strong>, whose work culminated in <strong><em>Dido and Aeneas</em></strong>. Purcell is the second-most performed of all Baroque opera composers.</p>

<p>Yet during the Baroque and Classical periods, the most active school of serious opera outside Italy was <strong>serious French opera</strong>, of which the outstanding figures are Lully and Rameau.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jean-Baptiste Lully</span> founded the French style of opera by merging Italian opera with the lavish French tradition of <strong>ballet</strong>. French opera consequently de-emphasizes the <strong>small-scale, individual level</strong> (arias) and emphasizes the <strong>large-scale, collective level</strong> (scenery, dance sequences, choruses). This emphasis continued to thrive in the works of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jean-Philippe Rameau</span>, the most-performed Baroque French opera composer, and one of the leading contenders for the title of "greatest ballet composer" (along with Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky).<span class="super">I264,3,6,8,9</span></p>

<h3>Comic Opera</h3>

<p><strong>Comic opera</strong> developed shortly after the maturation and diffusion of serious opera. As in serious opera, four major <strong>regional styles</strong> emerged: Italian, French, English, and German. Each style drew much from the native <strong>folk music</strong> and <strong>theatre</strong> of its region.</p>

<p>Yet all comic opera shares certain <strong>typical features</strong>, including catchy tunes, relatable storylines and settings, stock characters, and standard comedic genres (e.g. satirical, slapstick, bawdy). While many comic operas feature purely <strong>light-hearted</strong> stories, others balance the comedy with a measure of <strong>serious</strong> dramatic material.<span class="super">I303,2</span></p>

<p>Most of today's frequently-performed comic operas date from the <strong>Romantic</strong> period. A few (all Mozart) are Classical; none are Baroque.</p>
