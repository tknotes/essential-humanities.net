<h3>General Features</h3>

<p>The central aim of Romanticism is unrestrained <strong>emotional expression</strong> (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-supplementary/western-aesthetics">Western Aesthetics</a>). Romantic artists burst free of the <strong>limitations</strong> imposed by classicism (balance, harmony, clarity, simplicity), embracing whatever aesthetic techniques proved effective in capturing a particular feeling. Throughout the Romantic age, composers increasingly embraced <strong>abrupt shifts</strong> in dynamics and tempo, and experimented with novel <strong>melodies</strong> and <strong>chord progressions</strong>.<span class="super">1</span></p>

<p>The <strong>core period</strong> of Romantic music was ca. 1820-1900; like all aesthetic movements, however, the borders of this period are "soft". The roots of Romantic music lie some two decades earlier (in Beethoven's mid-career works), while the careers of some late Romantic composers stretched decades into the twentieth century. Romantic music can be divided into <strong>early</strong> and <strong>late</strong>, with a boundary of ca. 1860.</p>

<p>The <strong>mainstream</strong> world of Romantic music consisted of <strong>Germany</strong>, <strong>Austria</strong>, <strong>Italy</strong>, and <strong>France</strong>. Romantic music produced elsewhere is known as <strong>regional</strong>, as it tends to feature a distinct local flavour (e.g. Russian, Bohemian). Regional Romantic music flourished mainly during the <strong>late Romantic</strong> period.</p>

<p>During the Romantic age, the economic basis of Western art music shifted from private <strong>patrons</strong> (chiefly nobility and clergy) to public <strong>audiences</strong>, thanks to the Early Modern expansion of the middle class. Since patrons could exert a great deal of <strong>control</strong> over a composer's work (from types of works produced to time allowed for composition), the patronage system often curbed <strong>artistic freedom</strong>. Composers writing for <strong>public performance</strong>, on the other hand, retained professional autonomy, allowing <strong>experimentation</strong> to flourish like never before.</p>

<h2>Main Article</h2>

<h3>Chromaticism</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chromaticism</span> is the use of notes that lie <strong>outside the scale</strong> on which a passage is based. For instance, if a passage is written in the key of C major, the use of any note outside the C major scale (e.g. F sharp) constitutes chromaticism. While Baroque and Classical music typically feature some degree of chromaticism, Romantic music took the effect to new <strong>extremes</strong>, thereby opening a new world of possibilities for both <strong>melodies</strong> and <strong>chords</strong>.</p>

<p>Chromaticism can be used to shift between keys (e.g. from C major to G major). Again, while a moderate amount of <strong>key-shifting</strong> is common in Baroque and Classical works, Romantic composers used this technique with increasing frequency. The tendency culminated with <strong>Wagner</strong>, who wrote the first music in which the key <strong>constantly shifts</strong> about.<span class="super">12</span></p>

<h3>The Orchestra and the Piano</h3>

<p>During the Baroque age, the <strong>orchestra</strong> was dominated by the <strong>string section</strong>; the other three sections (<strong>woodwind</strong>, <strong>brass</strong>, and <strong>percussion</strong>) remained small. Throughout the Classical and early Romantic ages, the non-string sections grew steadily <strong>larger and more independent</strong>, culminating in the mature <strong>symphony orchestra</strong> of the late Romantic period (which remains the standard modern-day orchestra). Moreover, a wide range of instrumental <strong>combinations</strong> and <strong>techniques</strong> were pioneered during the Romantic age, thereby unleashing the full potential of <strong>orchestral expression</strong>. Late Romantic music is often easily distinguished from early Romantic work by the <strong>scale and diversity</strong> of its orchestration.<span class="super">I384</span></p>

<div class="slider-single">
<img class="slider-image" src="../../../img/art/typical-modern-orchestra-layout-diagram.png" alt="Typical Layout of a Modern Orchestra" data-credit="<a href='http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Orchester0.png'>Paris 16</a>">
</div>

<p>The development of the orchestra was paralleled by that of the <strong>piano</strong>. An invention of the late Baroque period, the piano gradually superseded the harpsichord as the <strong>primary keyboard instrument</strong> throughout the Classical age. During the Romantic period (the "golden age" of the piano), an unprecedented <strong>volume and diversity</strong> of music was produced for the piano, and the instrument's full expressive potential was achieved.<span class="super">I404</span></p>

<h3>Multi-movement Works</h3>

<p>A <span style="font-weight: bold;">multi-movement work</span> consists of multiple, self-contained works, each of which is referred to as a <strong>movement</strong>. Multi-movement works are common in Western music from the Baroque age onward. Typically, the movements <strong>vary</strong> in character (notably tempo) in order to provide contrast throughout the work.</p>

<p>In a work of <strong>absolute music</strong> (e.g. a symphony), each movement is typically named according to its <strong>tempo</strong> (e.g. allegro, andante). In a work of <strong>program music</strong> (e.g. a symphonic poem), each movement is typically named according to the <strong>imagery</strong> associated with the music (e.g. <em>Scene in the Country</em>, <em>Tortoises</em>). Sometimes a multi-movement work is called a <strong>suite</strong> (e.g. piano suite) or <strong>cycle</strong> (e.g. song cycle).</p>

<p>Up until the Romantic period, orchestral music was dominated by <strong>absolute music</strong>, namely the symphony and concerto. During the Romantic period, <span style="font-weight: bold;">orchestral program music</span> came to equal absolute music in popularity. A single-movement work of orchestral program music is often called a <strong>symphonic poem</strong> or <strong>tone poem</strong>, while a multi-movement work is often called a <strong>program symphony</strong>.</p>

<h3>Romantic Composer Types</h3>

<p>Romantic composers can be divided into <strong>three groups</strong>: full, conservative, and regional. The <strong>full Romantics</strong> pursued Romantic freedom <strong>unconditionally</strong>, while the <span style="font-weight: bold;">conservative Romantics</span> retained a significant degree of <strong>classicism</strong> (i.e. structure, clarity, simplicity). These two groups comprise the "mainstream" body of Romantic composers.</p>

<p>Beyond the mainstream lie the <span style="font-weight: bold;">regional Romantics</span>, who often infused Western art music with the <strong>folk music</strong> of their native lands. Regional Romanticism was a late development, flourishing mainly in the second half of the Romantic period. The most renowned strains of regional Romantic music are <strong>Russian</strong>, <strong>Bohemian</strong>, and <strong>Scandinavian</strong>.</p>

<p>The next three sections of this article explore each of the groups described above, with the omission of composers known primarily for <strong>opera</strong>.</p>

<h3>Full Romantics</h3><div class="date">ca. 1820-1900</div>

<p>The four most prominent <strong>full Romantics</strong> are Berlioz, Liszt, Chopin, and Richard Strauss.</p>

<p>French composer <strong>Hector Berlioz</strong> is known primarily for his three <strong>program symphonies</strong>. Foremost of these is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Symphonie fantastique</span> (his masterpiece), which relates an artist's doomed struggle with unrequited love; the others are <em>Harold in Italy</em> and <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. Berlioz was the leading early Romantic figure in the expansion of orchestral instrumentation and technique.<span class="super">I391</span></p>

<p><strong>Franz Liszt</strong>, a Hungarian composer, is remembered chiefly for his many <strong>piano works</strong>. These include etudes, waltzes, and "Hungarian rhapsodies", the latter of which draw upon the folk music of his native land. (A "rhapsody" is an emotional, through-composed work.) <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Sonata in B minor</span> is often considered his masterpiece.</p>

<p>Another leading Romantic piano composer was Polish-French <strong>Frederic Chopin</strong>, whose <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Sonata in B flat minor</span> is often identified as his greatest work. In addition to sonatas, Chopin worked in such genres as the mazurka (a traditional Polish dance), etude ("study", a work designed for practising specific technical skills), nocturne (a meditative, lyrical work), and waltz. Chopin was fond of <strong>tempo rubato</strong> ("free tempo"), a common feature of Romantic music, in which the performer freely adjusts the tempo throughout a performance.<span class="super">I409</span></p>

<p><strong>Richard Strauss</strong>, renowned chiefly as a composer of <strong>tone poems</strong>, was influenced so strongly by Wagner that he is known as a <strong>Wagnerian</strong>. ("Wagnerian" music features the typical qualities of Wagner's work, including frequent key-shifting, complex chords, and lush orchestration.) Strauss' most famous tone poem is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Thus Spake Zarathustra</span>.</p>

<h3>Conservative Romantics</h3><div class="date">ca. 1820-1900</div>

<p>The foremost <strong>conservative Romantics</strong> are Mendelssohn, Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms.</p>

<p><strong>Franz Schubert</strong> excelled primarily in <strong>symphonies</strong> and <strong>song cycles</strong>. His foremost symphonies are the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Great</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Unfinished</span>.</p>

<p>A <strong>lied</strong> ("song", plural "lieder") is a Romantic poem (typically German) arranged for <strong>voice and piano</strong>. A set of lieder is known as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">song cycle</span>. Schubert, often acknowledged as the greatest lied composer, wrote many song cycles, foremost of which are <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Die Winterreise</span> ("Winter Journey") and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Die schöne Müllerin</span> ("The Miller's Beautiful Daughter").</p>

<p><strong>Felix Mendelssohn</strong> is known mainly for <strong>orchestral works</strong>, especially the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Italian Symphony</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Overture to a Midsummer Night's Dream</span> (which includes the famous <em>Wedding March</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Robert Schumann</strong> is remembered chiefly for <strong>song cycles</strong> and <strong>piano cycles</strong>. (A "piano cycle" is a series of solo piano works.) His foremost song cycle is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Dichterliebe</span> ("Poet's Love"), while his most famous piano work is <span style="font-style: italic;">Traumerei</span> ("Dreaming"), from the cycle <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Kinderszenen</span> ("Scenes from Childhood").</p>

<p><strong>Johannes Brahms</strong> is often singled out as the greatest conservative Romantic. His most renowned works are the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">German Requiem</span> (often considered his masterpiece) and his four <strong>symphonies</strong>.</p>

<h3>Regional Romantics</h3><div class="date">ca. 1820-1900</div>

<p>Outside the "mainstream core" of Western art music (France/Italy/Germany/Austria), many composers broke new musical ground by merging native <strong>folk traditions</strong> with mainstream Romanticism. The result was <strong>regional Romanticism</strong>, of which the most renowned branches are <strong>Russian</strong>, <strong>Bohemian</strong>, and <strong>Scandinavian</strong>. (Bohemia was the pre-modern kingdom of the Czechs; "Bohemian" and "Czech" are often used interchangeably.) Other notable branches include <strong>Iberian</strong> and <strong>English</strong>.</p>

<p>Regional composers often disagreed on the appropriate balance of <strong>mainstream</strong> and <strong>native</strong> musical elements. This issue was especially prominent in <strong>Russia</strong>, where composers often came to be viewed as either "mainstream-focused" or "native-focused".</p>

<p>Foremost of the mainstream-focused Russian composers is <strong>Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky</strong>, often considered the greatest <strong>ballet</strong> composer of all time; his three masterpieces are <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Swan Lake</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Sleeping Beauty</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The Nutcracker</span>. Tchaikovsky's most famous non-ballet work is the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">1812 Overture</span>, which celebrates the Russian defeat of Napoleon's invasion.</p>

<p>Foremost of the native-focused Russian composers is <strong>Modest Mussorgsky</strong>.<span class="super">I465,I482</span> His best-known works are <strong><em>Night on Bald Mountain</em></strong> (a symphonic poem) and <strong><em>Pictures at an Exhibition</em></strong> (a piano cycle).</p>

<p>The foremost Bohemian Romantic composers are Smetana and Dvorak. <strong>Bedrich Smetana</strong> is known primarily for <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">My Country</span>, a set of six symphonic poems (of which <span style="font-style: italic;">Moldau</span> is the best-known). The outstanding masterpiece of <strong>Antonin Dvorak</strong> is the <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">New World Symphony</span>, composed while working in the United States.</p>

<p>Scandinavia also features two outstanding Romantic composers. Norway is represented by <strong>Edvard Grieg</strong>, whose most famous work is the orchestral suite <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Peer Gynt</span>. Finland's greatest composer, <strong>Jean Sibelius</strong>, is known primarily for the patriotic symphonic poem <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Finlandia</span>.</p>

<h2>Romantic Opera</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Both serious and comic opera were transformed by <strong>Romanticism</strong>. The bonds of classical structure and simplicity were loosened (or cast aside altogether), as composers strove to convey the full range of human <strong>emotion</strong> with precision and power.</p>

<p>From the Baroque to the early Romantic age, opera was typically neatly divided into <strong>narrative</strong> (plain speech or recitative, which advanced the story) and <strong>songs</strong> (which paused the story to highlight key elements). In the mid/late Romantic age, opera tended to embrace <strong>continuous narrative</strong>, in which the story unfolds constantly (throughout both speech/recitative and songs). Indeed, the distinction between recitative and songs was often <strong>blurred</strong>, as recitative became more lyrical and songs came to lack sharply-defined beginnings and endings.</p>

<p>The history of opera lies primarily in the <strong>core region</strong> of Western art music (France/Italy/Germany/Austria). By far the most popular opera composer from outside the core is <strong>Tchaikovsky</strong>, whose two most-performed operas are <strong><em>Eugene Onegin</em></strong> and <strong><em>Pikovaya Dama</em></strong> ("The Queen of Spades").</p>

<h3>Italian Romantic Opera</h3>

<p>Italian opera experienced a dramatic shift in tone throughout the Romantic period. The early Romantic was dominated by lively <strong>comic opera</strong>, the mid/late Romantic by starkly <strong>serious opera</strong>.</p>

<p>Mid/late Romantic Italian opera was initially dominated by <strong>Giuseppe Verdi</strong>, widely considered the greatest Italian opera composer (and today's most-performed opera composer). Verdi elevated the <strong>drama</strong> of Italian opera to a level equal to theatre (just as <strong>Wagner</strong> did for German opera). Up until the mid/late Romantic period, operas had tended to focus primarily on music, and consequently featured relatively simple, undeveloped stories.<span class="super">I449</span></p>

<p>Verdi, who worked almost entirely in serious opera, was influential for portraying heroism in characters of <strong>marginalized</strong> groups (e.g. slaves, prostitutes) and for his blunt <strong>social realism</strong>.<span class="super">3,14</span> His most popular works are <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">La traviata</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Rigoletto</span>, followed by <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Aida</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Nabucco</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Il trovatore</span>.<span class="super">15</span></p>

<p>Verdi's <strong>successors</strong>, who embraced and developed upon his overall style (including social realism), are known as the <strong>verismo school</strong> ("realism school").<span class="super">3</span> Their leader was <strong>Giacomo Puccini</strong>, today's third-most performed opera composer (after Verdi and Mozart), and the last great figure of Romantic opera. Puccini's three most popular works are <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">La Bohème</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Tosca</span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Madama Butterfly</span>.</p>

<p>Some opera composers are known almost exclusively for a single work. This is certainly true of the two leading figures of the verismo school after Puccini: <strong>Ruggero Leoncavallo</strong> (<em>Pagliacci</em>) and <strong>Pietro Mascagni</strong> (<em>Cavalleria rusticana</em>).</p>

<h3>French Romantic Opera</h3>

<p>French Romantic opera was (like Baroque and Classical French opera) rooted in Italian opera, but developed in uniquely French ways. French opera is renowned for its <strong>grandeur</strong>, achieved through such elements as large choruses, elaborate dance sequences, and opulent staging and costumes.</p>

<p>The foremost early Romantic composer of French opera was <strong>Hector Berlioz</strong>, whose most-performed works are <strong><em>La damnation de Faust</em></strong> ("The Damnation of Faust") and <strong><em>Les troyens</em></strong> ("The Trojans").</p>

</div>

<p>The mid/late Romantic period contains the four most popular French opera composers.</p>

<p>Leading the pack is <strong>Georges Bizet</strong>, whose <strong><em>Carmen</em></strong> is by far today's most-performed French opera; his other masterpiece is <strong><em>Les pêcheurs de perles</em></strong> ("The Pearl Fishers"). The most popular works of <strong>Jacques Offenbach</strong> are <em>Les contes d'Hoffmann</em> ("The Tales of Hoffman") and <em>Orphée aux enfers</em> ("Orpheus in the Underworld"); of <strong>Charles Gounod</strong>, <em>Faust</em> and <em>Roméo et Juliette</em>; and of <strong>Jules Massenet</strong>, <em>Werther</em>.</p>

<h3>Operetta</h3>

<p>Offenbach was the first great composer of <strong>operetta</strong>, which can be defined simply as "light opera". The story and music of an operetta are typically <strong>shorter</strong>, <strong>simpler</strong>, and more consistently <strong>light-hearted</strong> (often to ridiculous extremes) than those of an opera; operettas thus embody the <strong>transition</strong> from opera to musical theatre. Offenbach's most popular operetta is <strong><em>Orphée aux enfers</em></strong> ("Orpheus in the Underworld").</p>

<p>The leading centres of operetta were <strong>Paris</strong> and <strong>Vienna</strong>. While French operetta culminated with Offenbach, the foremost Austrian composer of the form was <strong>Johann Strauss II</strong>, whose <strong><em>Die Fledermaus</em></strong> ("The Bat") is the world's most-performed operetta. Strauss is also renowned for composing orchestral music in various <strong>dance</strong> forms, including marches, polkas, and (especially) waltzes, of which the most famous example is the <strong><em>Blue Danube</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Outside France and Austria, the most renowned composers of operetta are British duo <strong>Gilbert and Sullivan</strong>, whose foremost works may be <em>H.M.S. Pinafore</em>, <em>The Pirates of Penzance</em>, and <em>The Mikado</em>.</p>

<h3>German Romantic Opera</h3>

<p>In the Romantic period, serious German opera finally attained prominence equal to its Italian and French counterparts. Romantic German opera typically features <strong>supernatural</strong> characters and plots drawn from Germanic mythology; in some cases, ordinary humans are drawn into supernatural matters. The first great composer of Romantic German opera was <strong>Carl Maria von Weber</strong>, whose masterpiece is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Der Freischutz</span> ("The Marksman").<span class="super">I438,4</span></p>

<p>Weber was succeeded by the foremost German opera composer, <strong>Richard Wagner</strong>, who eventually abandoned the distinction between recitative and songs in favour of <strong>continuous melody</strong>. Wagner was also the first composer to make extensive use of the <strong>leitmotif</strong>, a musical theme associated with a particular character or idea. Wagner's four most-performed works are <strong><em>Der fliegende Holländer</em></strong> ("The Flying Dutchman"), <strong><em>Die Walküre</em></strong> ("The Valkyrie"), <strong><em>Das Rheingold</em></strong> ("The Rhine Gold"), and <strong><em>Tristan und Isolde</em></strong> ("Tristan and Isolde").<span class="super">I443-44,2</span></p>

<p>Wagner had two major successors. One was <strong>Richard Strauss</strong>, whose most popular operas are <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Salome</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Der Rosenkavalier</span> ("The Knight of the Rose"). The other was <strong>Engelbert Humperdinck</strong>, whose fame rests almost entirely on one opera: <strong><em>Hänsel und Gretel</em></strong>.</p>
