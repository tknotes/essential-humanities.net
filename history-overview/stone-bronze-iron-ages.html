<h1>The Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages</h1>

<h3>Prehistoric Climate</h3>

<p>Throughout its history, the Earth has cycled between cold <strong>glacial periods</strong> (during which large masses of ice, known as <strong>glaciers</strong>, cover much of the world's land area) and warm <strong>interglacial periods</strong> (which lack widespread glaciers). Humans have lived through many such cycles, which take place over thousands of years. While glacial periods made survival more difficult, they also lowered the sea level, easing human <strong>colonization</strong> of the world. We currently live in an interglacial period, which began ca. 10,000 BC.</p>

<h3>Pre-human Evolution</h3>

<p>About 14 billion years ago, the <strong>Big Bang</strong> gave birth to a universe containing pockets of dust. About 4.5 billion years ago, our <strong>solar system</strong> (the sun and its planets) formed via the accretion of dust into spheres; Earth is therefore roughly 4.5 billion years old. <strong>Life</strong> began about 3.5 billion years ago, with the appearance of <strong>single-celled</strong> marine organisms; since then, <strong>evolution</strong> has continuously given rise to new forms of life.<span class="super">53,54,55</span></p>

<p>Eventually, <strong>multicellular</strong> organisms developed. Increasingly large and complex types of multicellular life emerged, with one branch of evolution leading to <strong>fish</strong>. Fish are the original <strong>vertebrates</strong> (animals with a backbone) and the ancestors of all other vertebrate groups.</p>

<p>Vertebrates made the transition to land-based life when fish evolved into <strong>amphibians</strong>: cold-blooded tetrapods that lay aquatic eggs. The term <strong>cold-blooded</strong> denotes that a creature's internal temperature is determined by its environment (in contrast to <strong>warm-blooded</strong> creatures, whose bodies maintain an internal temperature independent of their environment). A <strong>tetrapod</strong> is a creature with four limbs; a <strong>limb</strong> is a jointed appendage that extends from an animal's body. An <strong>aquatic egg</strong> is laid in water, and thus lacks a hard shell.</p>

<p>Amphibians evolved into <strong>reptiles</strong>, which lay <strong>hard-shelled eggs</strong>. Consequently, reptiles were the first vertebrates that could live their entire lives on <strong>dry land</strong>. The final two major vertebrate groups, <strong>birds</strong> and <strong>mammals</strong>, evolved from reptiles.</p>

<p>Some mammals came to abandon a ground-based life, evolving to swing among the <strong>trees</strong>. This lifestyle encouraged the development of hands with <strong>dextrous fingers</strong> and <strong>opposable thumbs</strong> (for grasping branches), as well as <strong>sharp colour eyesight</strong> (for navigating the complex, multicoloured, shadowy environment of the forest).<span class="super">A3</span> <strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong> was one region where tree-dwelling mammals thrived.</p>

<p>One day, a species of Sub-Saharan tree-dwelling mammal returned to a ground-based life, leaving the forests behind for open <strong>grassland</strong>. This animal subsequently evolved to walk <strong>upright</strong> (rather than on all fours), allowing it to see much farther across the plains. (Animals that walk upright are referred to as <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=biped002&word=bipedal&text=\%28%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3E%29b%C4%AB-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Epe-d%3Csup%3E%C9%99%3C%2Fsup%3El\">bipedal</a>.) When these bipedal mammals started to develop <strong>larger brains</strong>, they evolved into a remarkable new creature: <strong>human</strong>.</p>

<h2>Main Article</h2>

<h3>Paleolithic Age</h3>

<p>The term <strong>human</strong> denotes any creature belonging to the genus <span style="font-style: italic;">Homo</span>. The first species of human was <a class="tipboldic" href="http://www.howjsay.com/index.php?word=Homo+habilis">Homo habilis</a>, which evolved in Sub-Saharan Africa ca. 2,500,000 BC. Since <span style="font-style: italic;">Homo habilis</span> was a maker of stone tools, the evolution of this species marks the beginning of the <strong>stone age</strong>.<span class="super">56</span></p>

<p>The stone age can be divided into the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=paleol02&word=Paleolithic&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Ep%C4%81-l%C4%93-%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Eli-thik%2C%20%3Cem%3Eespecially%20British%3C%2Fem%3E%20%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Epa-\">Paleolithic</a> ("Old Stone Age"), during which all humans were hunter-gatherers; the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=mesoli01&word=Mesolithic&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eme-z%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Eli-thik\">Mesolithic</a> ("Middle Stone Age"), the transitional phase to agricultural life; and the <a class="tipbold" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=neolit02&word=neolithic&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3En%C4%93-%C9%99-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Eli-thik\">Neolithic</a> ("New Stone Age"), when humans subsisted through agriculture. The Paleolithic, which spans over ninety percent of human existence, can be further divided into three parts.</p>

<p>The <strong>Lower Paleolithic</strong> was the age of human evolution. Various species of <span style="font-style: italic;">Homo</span> emerged, with a trend toward increasing <strong>brain and body size</strong>.<span class="super">43</span> The evolution of modern humans, <a class="tipboldic" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/audio.php?file=homosa01&word=Homo%20sapiens&text=\%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eh%C5%8D-%28%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3E%29m%C5%8D-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Es%C4%81-p%C4%93-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%8C%3C%2Fspan%3Eenz%2C%20-%C9%99nz%2C%20%3Cem%3Eespecially%20British%3C%2Fem%3E%20-%3Cspan%20class%3D%22unicode%22%3E%CB%88%3C%2Fspan%3Esa-p%C4%93-%C9%99nz\">Homo sapiens</a>, finally took place ca. 200,000 BC, in Sub-Saharan Africa.<span class="super">12</span></p>

<p>To recap: the Lower Paleolithic period began with the evolution of <strong><em>Homo habilis</em></strong> (the first human species) and concluded with the evolution of <strong><em>Homo sapiens</em></strong>. The latter species was anatomically the same as present-day humans, including (most importantly) <strong>brain size</strong>.<span class="super">56</span></p>

</table>

<p>The next giant leap for our species was <span style="font-weight: bold;">behavioural modernity</span> (aka "modern behaviour"), which emerged ca. 50,000 BC. Humans of the Lower and Middle Paleolithic exhibited <strong>primitive behaviour</strong>; though they could make simple stone tools and eventually came to control fire, these humans did not behave much differently than the rest of the animal kingdom. The contrast between humans and animals only became sharp with the onset of <strong>modern behaviour</strong>.<span class="super">4,56</span></p>

<p>Behavioural modernity can be boiled down to two major features: <strong>complex ideas</strong> and <strong>creativity</strong>. The consequences of behavioural modernity include government, religion, art, and technology.<span class="super">4,56</span></p>

<p>As noted above, various <strong>species of human</strong> evolved in Sub-Saharan Africa prior to the evolution of modern humans. Some of these species <strong>migrated</strong> out of Africa, settling regions of Eurasia. All would eventually go <strong>extinct</strong>, however, leaving the world to be dominated by a single human species: <strong><em>Homo sapiens</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Modern humans <strong>colonized</strong> most of the inhabitable world during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods. The Americas were colonized by a great migration across the <strong>Bering land bridge</strong>, which connected Siberia and Alaska.<span class="super">2,22</span></p>

<h3>Neolithic Age</h3>

<p>During the Paleolithic age, all humans were <strong>hunter-gatherers</strong>. They typically lived in <strong>small bands</strong> that followed an annual migration pattern, timing their movements according to ripening plants and travelling herds of game. Depending on food availability, these bands might be <strong>nomadic</strong> (constantly on the move) or <strong>semi-nomadic</strong> (migrating between temporary settlements).<span class="super">K30-31,18</span></p>

<p><strong>Paleolithic life</strong> denotes a lifestyle based mainly on <strong>hunting/gathering</strong>, while <strong>Neolithic life</strong> denotes a lifestyle based mainly on <strong>agriculture</strong> (the production of food by raising domesticated crops and animals). A given region is considered to have progressed to the Neolithic age once agriculture has become the primary means of subsistence.</p>

<p>Prior to reaching the Neolithic, humans experienced a <strong>transitional stage</strong> known as the <strong>Mesolithic</strong>. The transition to agricultural life commenced ca. 10,000 BC, when the most recent <strong>glacial period</strong> ended, giving rise to a warmer (and thus more farming-conducive) global climate. The beginning of the Mesolithic age is consequently placed at <strong>ca. 10,000 BC</strong>; the ending, however, varies by region.</p>

<p>As noted earlier, hunting/gathering-based life is also known as <strong>Paleolithic life</strong>. This is only true up until ca. 10,000 BC, however; the continuation of hunting/gathering-based life beyond ca. 10,000 BC (in the new, warmer climate) is known as <strong>Mesolithic life</strong>.</p>

<p>Over the <strong>final ten millennia BC</strong> (ca. 10,000 BC-0), most of the world transitioned to the Neolithic age. The unfolding of this transition can be <strong>mapped</strong> with very rough approximations for individual regions. For instance, Neolithic life was achieved in Mesopotamia ca. 10,000 BC; in Greece, ca. 7000 BC; in India, ca. 5000 BC; in Britain, ca. 3000 BC.<span class="super">4,18</span>

<p>As the above map illustrates, Neolithic life <strong>radiated</strong> from Mesopotamia, both across Eurasia and into North Africa. (It should be noted that while most of Eurasia adopted agriculture as it diffused from Mesopotamia, some regions may have developed agriculture independently.) The diffusion of agriculture to <strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong>, however, was frustrated by the vast Sahara Desert; across this region, agriculture-based life only emerged over the last two millennia BC.<span class="super">4,38,47</span></p>

<p>In the <strong>Americas</strong>, Neolithic life was first achieved in Mesoamerica and Peru, but not until ca. 2000 BC. Thus, the rise of Neolithic life throughout the New World was (as in Sub-Saharan Africa) compressed into the final two millennia BC.<span class="super">4,44,46</span></p>

<h3>Alternatives to Farming</h3>

<p>Some parts of the world forwent agriculture altogether. In these regions, one of two <strong>alternative subsistence methods</strong> was pursued.</p>

<p>The first alternative was to continue with <span style="font-weight: bold;">hunter-gatherer life</span> indefinitely. This path was followed by <strong>Australia</strong>, much of <strong>Siberia</strong>, much of the <strong>Americas</strong> (the far north and south), and parts of <strong>Sub-Saharan Africa</strong>. Though hunter-gatherer societies have mostly disappeared in the modern age, a few small populations survive; perhaps most famous are the San people of Sub-Saharan Africa and tribes of the Amazon rainforest.<span class="super">K30-31,4</span></p>

<p>The second alternative was <span style="font-weight: bold;">nomadic herding life</span>. Nomadic herding is well-suited to <strong>arid regions</strong>, where rainfall is sufficient for grass but too scarce for productive farming; typical herd animals are sheep, goats, cattle, horses, camels (in the Islamic world), and reindeer (in Siberia). Nomadic herding was especially successful in the <strong>Steppe</strong> (an east-west strip of grassland that runs from Ukraine to Mongolia).<span class="super">48</span> Like hunter-gatherer life, nomadic herding has been mostly (but not entirely) displaced by the modern age.</p>

<h3>The Eurasian Advantage</h3>

<p>As described above, the Neolithic age was achieved far earlier in <strong>Eurasia</strong> than elsewhere. Since Neolithic life was the crucial prerequisite to <strong>urbanization</strong>, Eurasia experienced the rise of cities thousands of years before the rest of the world. Consequently, Eurasia has given rise to most of the world's <strong>civilizations</strong>, including the four current "global civilizations": Western, Islamic, South Asian, and East Asian (see <a href="global-civilizations/global-civilizations.html">Global Civilizations</a>). The modern global <strong>political and cultural landscape</strong> has been shaped primarily by Eurasia and its colonial offshoots.</p>

<p>Outside Eurasia, the Neolithic age was delayed for various reasons. One is sheer <strong>geographic isolation</strong> from Southwest Asia, the leading region of early technological progress. While advances in Southwest Asia were transmitted to Europe and Asia relatively quickly, they were <strong>blocked</strong> from spreading easily to Sub-Saharan Africa (by the Sahara Desert) and the Americas (by the oceans).</p>

<p>Eurasia was also blessed with an exceptional supply of <strong>domesticatable plants and animals</strong>, in terms of both quantity and quality of species.<span class="super">51</span> In this context, "quality" denotes usefulness for humans. High-quality domesticated plants are energy-rich and relatively easy to produce; high-quality domesticated animals also have these characteristics, as well as provision of labour and non-food animal products.</p>

<p>The Eurasian advantage in <strong>domesticatable animals</strong> is particularly striking. Peoples across this region were blessed with goats, sheep, pigs, horses, and cattle (among others); notably, the latter two animals could be harnessed for <strong>heavy labour</strong>, including ploughing (which amplified farming production) and transportation. In fact, only fourteen <strong>large animal species</strong> (that is, animals in excess of 100 pounds) have ever been domesticated, and only one of these is native to a region outside Eurasia: the llama, in South America.<span class="super">51</span></p>

<h3>Bronze and Iron Ages</h3>

<p>The Neolithic age was succeeded in Eurasia by the <strong>bronze age</strong>. In a given region, the bronze age is considered to begin when bronze becomes a <strong>much-used material</strong> for practical objects (i.e. tools and weapons). The term "bronze age" is generally not applied if only a few bronze tools are being made, or if bronze is only being used for jewellery.</p>

<p>The key prerequisite to the bronze age was the development of <span style="font-weight: bold;">smelting</span> (the process of extracting metal from ore). Once a sufficient volume of metal has been smelted, it can be <strong>hammered</strong> or <strong>cast</strong> (melted and poured into a mould) into a desired shape. Smelting technology first emerged in <strong>Southwest Asia</strong>.<span class="super">9</span></p>

<p>The first metal to be smelted was <strong>copper</strong>. Being a rather soft metal, copper was not a dramatic improvement over stone for the crafting of tools and weapons. It was eventually discovered, however, that by blending copper with tin, one obtains a much harder metal: <span style="font-weight: bold;">bronze</span>. (Occasionally, other elements were used instead of tin.)<span class="super">9,50</span></p>

<p>The <strong>bronze age</strong> of Southwest Asia spanned ca. 3000-1000 BC. Like agriculture, bronze technology <strong>radiated</strong> from Southwest Asia in all directions, taking roughly a thousand years to cover the entire east-west span of mainland Eurasia (from Britain to China). Thus, by ca. 2000 BC, most of Eurasia had transitioned to the bronze age.<span class="super">1,26,52</span> While the bronze age also diffused to North Africa, it was halted by the Sahara Desert.</p>

<div class="spacer"></div>

<p>The <strong>iron age</strong> began in Southwest Asia ca. 1000 BC, once smelting pit designs had advanced sufficiently to produce the higher temperatures needed to smelt iron ore (see <a href="http://www.essential-humanities.net/art-supplementary/iron-smelting">Iron Smelting</a>).<span class="super">9</span> In about five centuries, it covered the east-west span of <strong>Eurasia</strong>. Thus, by ca. 500 BC, most of Eurasia had transitioned to the iron age.<span class="super">27,28</span></p>

<p>The iron age also diffused across North Africa, and then (unlike the bronze age) southward across <strong>sub-Saharan Africa</strong>. It crossed the Sahara Desert by travelling down the Nile (through Egypt into Nubia), and may also have crossed at other points farther west. Diffusion was slower than in Eurasia; it took about a thousand years for the iron age to reach southern Africa.<span class="super">38,47</span></p>

<p>It should be noted that the above descriptions of the spread of the bronze and iron ages are meant to convey the broad, overall picture. Most likely, these ages did not begin solely in Southwest Asia, but were arrived at independently (at later dates) in other regions as well.</p>

<p>The transition to the iron age was critical not because of any property of the metal itself (iron is not harder than bronze), but rather because iron is overwhelmingly more <strong>abundant</strong> than copper and tin. This enabled, for the first time in history, true <strong>mass-production</strong> of metal tools and weapons. Both <strong>agriculture</strong> and <strong>warfare</strong> (to take two prominent examples) were thereby revolutionized, since metal implements are far more effective than stone in both endeavours.</p>

<p>The bronze and iron ages have little relevance for the pre-colonial <strong>Americas</strong>. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the bronze age was reached only by the <strong>Inca</strong> (the final Andean civilization), while the iron age did not occur at all.<span class="super">7,33</span> Gold, silver, and copper were widely used in pre-colonial American art, however.<span class="super">49</span></p>
